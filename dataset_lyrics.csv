Ku cinta kau lebih dari kemarin,Abdul dan Coffee theory,"Maafkanku bila
Ku kurang romantis
Tak segombal lelaki lain
Memang diriku tak penuh kejutan
Tak mampu guncangkan dunia
Namun kau pun tahu
Hati ini hanya untukmu
Namun kau pun tahu
Ku tak dapat hidup
Tanpa dirimu
Kucinta kau
Saat ini
Lebih dari hari yang kemarin
Dan akan ku beri kau
Lebih dan lebih
Sampai akhir hayat nanti
Percayalah padaku
Cinta ini
Takkan pernah mati
Karena hanya padamu
Telah aku temukan
Satu cinta yang tulus
Dan jujur untuk diriku"
Selalu Ada,Abdul dan Coffee theory,"Saat aku sendiri kuteringat wajahmu
Dengan baju favoritmu kau tersenyum kepadaku
Kuingat selalu cara tawamu kau buat kubahagia
Oh kasih hanya kamu
Di dalam khayalku kau selalu ada
Di dalam hatiku kau selalu ada
Saat kita bersama saat kita berpisah
Walau kini kau bukan milikku lagi
Kau selalu ada
Saat kututup mata kudengar suaramu (kamu di mana)
Nyanyi lagu favoritmu ketika kau sedang rindu
Karena candamu juga tawamu kau buat kubahagia
Kasih hanya kamu
Di dalam khayalku kau selalu ada
Di dalam hatiku kau selalu ada
Saat kita bersama saat kita berpisah
Walau kini kau bukan milikku lagi
Kau selalu ada
Kadang cinta tak harus memiliki
Ku tak peduli asal kau ada oh
Di dalam khayalku kau selalu ada
Di dalam hatiku kau selalu ada
Saat kita bersama saat kita berpisah
Walau kini kau bukan milikku lagi
Di dalam khayalku kau selalu ada
Di dalam hatiku kau selalu ada
Saat kita bersama saat kita berpisah
Walau kini kau bukan milikku lagi
Kau selalu ada
Selalu ada"
Aku Suka Caramu,Abdul dan Coffee theory,"Aku suka caramu membuatku tersenyum
Saat hari ku kelabu
Aku suka caramu tertawa riang
Saat kau datang menyambutku
Aku suka semua perhatianmu

Tercipta untuk jadi satu
Engkau dan aku

Agar kau mengerti,Abdul dan Coffee theory,"Aku tak pernah bisa
Tuk kau beri dunia
Aku tak pernah bisa
Tuk kau beri setumpuk kata cinta
Yang aku ingin hanyalah pengertianmu
Tuk sedikit saja pahami maksudku
Yang aku ingin hanyalah agar kau mau
Sekedar mengerti aku

Untuk semua waktumu

Kau beri semua yang engkau punya

Dulu aku percaya
Ku kan mampu menaklukkan dunia
Saat kau ada
Dulu ku merasa hidup

Tiada batas menunggu,Abdul dan Coffee theory,"Telah lama ku memendam rasa
Cinta ini untuk dirimu
Dan kini saatnya aku mengatakan padamu
Kuharap kau dapat menerima
Jujur aku tak dapat berpaling yeah
Bila hati t'lah tentukan pilihan
Aku tak memaksa kau untuk menjawab saat ini
Pakai saja waktu yang kau butuhkan
Hei kuharap kau percaya
Kesungguhanku padamu
Satu dua minggu akan kutunggu
Dua tiga bulan masih kutunggu
Empat lima tahun ku masih disini
Sampai bulan tak bersinar
Dan mentari telah sirna
Ku akan tetap setia menunggu
Kini bukan waktunya untukku
Bermain dengan hati
Aku mencari seorang kekasih
Yang setia padaku
Untuk selamanya oh
Satu dua minggu akan kutunggu
Dua tiga bulan masih kutunggu
Empat lima tahun ku masih disini
Sampai bulan tak bersinar
Dan mentari telah sirna

Sampai bulan tak bersinar
Dan mentari telah sirna
Hari-hari telah hilang
Ku akan tetap setia menunggu"
Dunia ini indah,Abdul dan Coffee theory,"Kau datang kepadaku dengan segala gundahmu
Kau curahkan kesalmu yang kini kau alami
Dan kau pun membisu

"
Proses melupakan,Abdul dan Coffee theory,"Senin, 3 Januari, ku coba menyingkirkan
Semua benda kenangan, yang ku dapat darimu
Selasa, ku kumpulkan semua teman-temanku
Dan ku buat hari ini yang terindah bagiku
Namun tetap ku tak mampu melupakan dirimu
Dan bayangmu masih saja hantui aku
Itulah prosesku
Itulah prosesku
Itulah prosesku
Melupakanmu
Rabu, aku menunggu kabar dari dirimu
Tangisku coba mencarimu
Namun kau entah di mana
Jumat, aku putuskan ini hari terakhirku
Bagiku untuk meratapi kamu
Namun tetap ku tak mampu melupakan dirimu
Dan bayangmu masih saja hantui aku
Itulah prosesku
Itulah prosesku
Itulah prosesku
Melupakanmu
Dan ku tak mampu
Menjalani semua
Hari-hari tanpamu
Dan aku tak tahu
Apa yang kulakukan
Untuk dapat melupakan kamu, ohh hu hu
Satu minggu ku mencoba mencari penggantimu
Namun kau masih yang terbaik untuk aku
Itulah prosesku
Itulah prosesku
Itulah prosesku
Melupakanmu"
Jangan Bandingkan Aku,Abdul dan Coffee theory,"Telah lama kita jalani
Cerita cinta kita
Namun masa lalumu
Terus menghantui dalam setiap langkahku
Telah lama aku mencoba
Jadi yang terbaik untukmu
Namun bayangan dirinya tak dapat kau lupa
Di setiap cerita
Biarkan aku mencintaimu
Dengan seluruh rasa cintaku
Biarkan aku menyayangimu setulus hati
Jangan bandingkan aku dengannya
Nilai saja tulus cintaku
Tak ingin sisa cinta yang lain untuk diriku
Jangan bandingkan ku dengannya
Harus bagaimana ku dapat berharap
Tuk milikimu dengan seutuhnya
Harus bagaimana ku harus berbuat
Tuk dapat menggapai hatimu
Biarkanlah ku mencintaimu dengan seluruh rasa cintaku
Biarkanlah ku menyayangimu setulus hati
Ho wo
Jangan bandingkan aku dengannya nilai saja tulus cintaku
Tak ingin sisa cinta yang lain untuk diriku
Jangan bandingkan ku dengannya oh
Jangan bandingkan ku dengannya"
Masih,ADA Band,"Rasa cinta yang dulu tlah hilang
Kini bersemi kembali
Tlah kau coba lupakan dirinya hapus cerita lalu
Dan lihatlah
Dirimu bagai bunga dimusim semi
Yang tersenyum
Menatap indahnya dunia yang seiring menyambut
Jawaban sgala gundahmu
Walau badai menghadang
Ingatlah ku kan selalu setia menjagamu
Berdua kita lewati jalan yang berliku tajam
Setiap waktu wajahmu yang lugu
selalu menjadi langkahku
Telah lama menanti dirimu
Tempat ku kan berlabuh
Cahaya hatiku
Yakinlah kekal abadi selamanya
Seperti bintang
Yang sinarnya terangi seluruh ruang dijiwa
Membawa kedamaian
Walau badai menghadang
Ingatlah ku kan selalu setia menjagamu
Berdua kita lewati jalan yang berliku tajam
Resah yang kau rasakan
Kan jadi bagian hidupku
Bersamamu
Letakanlah segala lara
Di pundakku ini"
Haruskah Kumati,ADA Band,"Bagaimana mestinya
Membuatmu jatuh hati kepadaku?
T'lah kutuliskan sejuta puisi
Meyakinkanmu membalas cintaku
Haruskah ku mati karenamu?
Terkubur dalam kesedihan sepanjang waktu
Haruskah kurelakan hidupku?
Hanya demi cinta yang mungkin bisa membunuhku
Hentikan denyut nadi jantungku
Tanpa kau tahu betapa suci hatiku
Untuk memilikimu
Adakah keikhlasan
Dalam palung jiwamu mengetukku?
Ajarkanmu bahasa perasaan
Hingga hatimu tak lagi membeku
Haruskah ku mati karenamu?
Terkubur dalam kesedihan sepanjang waktu
Haruskah kurelakan hidupku?
Hanya demi cinta yang mungkin bisa membunuhku
Hentikan denyut nadi jantungku
Tanpa kau tahu betapa suci hatiku
Untuk memilikimu
Tiadakah ruang di hatimu untukku
Yang mungkin bisa 'tuk kusinggahi?
Hanya sekedar penyejuk di saat ku layu
Ku s'lalu menantimu hingga akhir masa, oh
Haruskah ku mati karenamu?
Terkubur dalam kesedihan sepanjang waktu
Haruskah kurelakan hidupku?
Hanya demi cinta yang mungkin bisa membunuhku
Hentikan denyut nadi jantungku
Tanpa kau tahu betapa suci hatiku
Untuk memilikimu"
Surga CInta,ADA Band,"Terdiam, hanya bisa diam
Dingin menyerang
Di sekujur tubuhku
Layangkan mata menembus cahaya
Putih kilaunya
Meneduhkan lamunan
Masih jelas terlihat pesona ayumu
Masih jelas terasa getar dawai jiwamu
Inikah surga cinta yang banyak orang pertanyakan?
Atau hanya mimpi yang tiada pernah berakhir jua
Perlahan bawa semua tanya
Satu bersama
Langkah di taman ini
Terangkai bunga tanda cinta murni adanya
Tapi kekasih pun tiada
Muncul hapus rinduku
Inikah surga cinta yang banyak orang pertanyakan?
Atau hanya mimpi yang tiada pernah berakhir jua
Di mana aku sedang berada, mengapa sendiri?
Lari telanjang tanpa seorang pun yang akan mempeduli
Inikah surga cinta yang banyak orang pertanyakan?
Atau hanya mimpi yang tiada pernah berakhir jua
Terbanglah cinta, sampaikan sayangku hanya bagi dia
Hanya rasa sepi meratapi malam tanpa dirinya
"
Kau Aura Ku,ADA Band,"Malam kehadiran cinta, sambut jiwa baru
Telah lama kutunggu hadirmu di sini
Namun hanya ruang semu yang nampak padaku
Meski sulit harus kudapatkan
Kerinduan yang mendalam, terbitkan hasratku
Sambutlah tangan ini, terima janjiku
Rasakan cinta yang tulus lewat aliran darahmu
Menyatu seiring dalam kasih
Kau auraku, oh, pancarkan sepercik harapan
Datanglah merasuk, menjelma, meleburkan cinta
Kubawa kau terbang menembus awan yang beriring
Kembangkan senyuman bagai bunga bawa keindahan
Oh-wo-wo-wo
Tak dapat kusangkali adanya dirimu
Yang s'lalu menaungi pikiran batinku
Ingin miliki hatimu, takkan pernah terlepaskan
Kupersembahkan semua padamu
Kau auraku, oh, pancarkan sepercik harapan
Datanglah merasuk, menjelma, meleburkan cinta
Kubawa kau terbang menembus awan yang beriring
Kembangkan senyuman bagai bunga bawa keindahan
Uh-wo-oh-wo
Kau auraku, oh, pancarkan sepercik harapan
Datanglah merasuk, menjelma, meleburkan cinta
Kubawa kau terbang menembus awan yang beriring
Kembangkan senyuman bagai bunga bawa keindahan
Kau auraku"
Jadikan Aku Raja,ADA Band,"Betapa dalam
Rasa kasihku padamu
Yang s'lalu membayangi
Di setiap liku jalanku
Membawa terang
Yang menuntun
Langkah hidupku
Kekasihku, tersenyumlah
Bawa ku ke duniamu
Jadikan aku raja bagimu
Dalam istana hatimu
Walau kini kau tak lagi
Temani ragaku ini
Cintaku hanya untuk
Engkau seorang
Bila t'lah tiba
Waktuku untuk dirimu
Nantikan jiwa ini
Di gerbang hatimu
Bawa anganku
Raih semua
Bintang di langit
Kekasihku, tersenyumlah
Bawa ku ke duniamu
Jadikan aku raja bagimu
Dalam istana hatimu
Walau kini kau tak lagi
Temani ragaku ini
Cintaku hanya untuk
Engkau seorang
Kekasihku, tersenyumlah
Bawa ku ke duniamu
Jadikan aku raja bagimu
Dalam istana hatimu
Walau kini kau tak lagi
Temani ragaku ini
Cintaku hanya untuk
Engkau seorang
"
Kucuri Lagi Hatimu,ADA Band,"Gelisah merindukan pelukmu
Salahku meninggalkanmu oh kasihku
Maafkan salahku dulu
Aku sayang kepadamu
Andaikan ku curi lagi hatimu
Percayalah hanya padamu cintaku
Kamulah harta yang paling indah
Ku sayang dan selalu ku jaga kekasih
Selalu terbayangkan wajahmu
Terbawa di setiap waktu dan mimpiku
Maafkan salahku dulu aku sayang kepadamu
Andaikan ku curi lagi hatimu (kucuri hatimu)
Percayalah hanya padamu cintaku
Kamulah harta yang paling indah
Ku sayang dan selalu ku jaga kekasih
Belahlah dadaku
Lihat betapa besarnya cinta ini
Andaikan ku curi lagi hatimu
Percayalah hanya padamu cintaku
Kamulah harta yang paling indah
Ku sayang dan selalu ku jaga kekasih
Andaikan ku curi lagi hatimu
Percayalah hanya padamu cintaku
Kamulah harta yang paling indah
Ku sayang dan selalu ku jaga kekasih
"
Akal Sehat,ADA Band,"Dulu kumencintaimu
Terasa bahagia
Namun kau hilang tanpa jejak
Membuat bertanya
Apa salah diriku
Hapus memori itu
Tak semudah dibayangkan
Bagai hantu di siang malam
Mendera batinku
Bayang dirimu begitu merasuk kalbu
Akal sehatku berhenti
Kala menatap indah matamu
Hingga melumpuhkan jiwa
Kau mencuri perhatian dan sayangku
Takkan lagi kupungkiri semua
Saat kucoba tegar
Hadirmu kembali
Ada dera di sekujur tubuh
Lelah 'tuk berpikir
Sakit kumelihatnya
Bawa sejuta maaf
Entah dari hati
Letakkan janji sekali lagi
Di atas segalanya
Adakah ini hanya pelarian tanpa ujung
Akal sehatku berhenti
Kala menatap indah matamu
Hingga melumpuhkan jiwa
Kau mencuri perhatian dan sayangku
Takkan lagi kupungkiri semua
Akal sehatku berhenti
Kala menatap indah matamu
Hingga melumpuhkan jiwa
Kau mencuri perhatian dan sayangku
Takkan lagi kupungkiri semua
Akal sehatku berhenti
Kala menatap indah matamu
Hingga melumpuhkan jiwa
Kau mencuri perhatian dan sayangku
Takkan lagi kupungkiri semua
Aku memang cinta padamu"
Biarkan Ku Pergi,ADA Band,"Jangan terus kau tangisi
Semua yang terjadi bila akhirnya kumeninggalkanmu
Kumohon kau sanggup lupakan diriku
Yang telah hancurkan mimpimu
Bukan ku tak menyayangmu
Namun ku tak bisa jadikanmu kekasih yang sejati
Di situ relakan diriku tak selamanya cinta harus memiliki
Sayangku biarkan ku pergi
Tiada lagi sendiri sebelum waktu dulu
Maafkan jika ku tak bisa
Menjaga tulusnya cinta di dalam dirimu
Lepaskan beban batinmu
Kuatkanlah diri tak satupun di dunia yang abadi
Di situ jangan kau sembunyi kadang cinta itu layaknya cobaan
Sayangku biarkan ku pergi
Tiada lagi sendiri sebelum waktu dulu
Maafkan jika ku tak bisa
Menjaga tulusnya cinta di dalam dirimu
Sayangku biarkan ku pergi
Tiada lagi sendiri sebelum waktu dulu
Maafkan jika ku tak bisa
Menjaga tulusnya cinta di dalam dirimu
Sayangku biarkan ku pergi
Tiada lagi sendiri sebelum waktu dulu
Maafkan jika ku tak bisa
Menjaga tulusnya cinta di dalam dirimu
Sayangku biarkan ku pergi
Tiada lagi sendiri sebelum waktu dulu
Maafkan jika ku tak bisa
Menjaga tulusnya cinta di dalam dirimu"
Semenit Waktu,ADA Band,"Di pelukanku terakhir kali kau katakan cinta
Putih dan suci yang kau persembahkan
Seperti janji manis
Bila malam menjelang ingin kuhitung lagi
Segenap jumlah bintang yang bersinar di wajahmu
Akhirnya semua telah berakhir bagai mimpi buruk
Menerjang ruang batin hidupku tak berperasaan
Ku diam tertegun menatap pilu dirimu kau begitu indah
Dunia serasa mati hilang semangat hidup
Aku rindu padamu aku teramat sayang
Jika ini takdirku bolehkah ku berharap
Semenit waktu ingin kubalas kata cinta
Harusnya ku berlari mengejar kepergianmu
Takkan terulang kisah dua anak manusia
Dunia serasa mati hilang semangat hidup
Aku rindu padamu aku teramat sayang
Jika ini takdirku bolehkah ku berharap
Semenit waktu ingin kubalas kata cinta
Di pelukanku terakhir kali"
Karena Wanita,ADA Band,"Lekuk indah hadirkan pesona
Kemuliaan bagi yang memandang
Setiamu simbol keanggunan khas perawan
Yang kau miliki
Akulah pengagum ragamu
Tak ingin kumenyakitimu
Lindungi dari sengat dunia yang mengancam nodai sucinya lahirmu
Karena wanita ingin dimengerti
Lewat tutur lembut dan laku agung
Karena wanita ingin dimengerti
Manjakan dia dengan kasih sayang
Ingin kuajak engkau menari
Bermandi hangat cahaya bulan
Sebagai tanda kebahagiaan
Bagi semesta cinta kita
Karena wanita ingin dimengerti
Lewat tutur lembut dan laku agung
Karena wanita ingin dimengerti
Manjakan dia dengan kasih sayang
Bintang terang itulah dirimu
Janganlah redup dan mati
Aku dibelakangmu memeluk dan menjagamu
Karena wanita ingin dimengerti
Lewat tutur lembut dan laku agung
Karena wanita ingin dimengerti
Manjakan dia dengan kasih sayang
Karena wanita ingin dimengerti
Lewat tutur lembut dan laku agung
Karena wanita ingin dimengerti
Manjakan dia dengan kasih sayang"
Pemujamu,ADA Band,"Kali ini ku tlah jatuh ke dalam
Dosa begitu besar
Terlalu mencintai
Begitu dalam
Mata itu berhasil hipnotisku
Menjerat nafsu jiwa
Mengurungku kedalam keindahan
Rasanya ingin malam ini
Menciummu hingga lemas
Rasanya ingin malam ini
Memelukmu hingga terlelap
Kau bagaikan simbol semesta alam
Dan aku pemujamu
Setiap saat bersimpuh dihadapmu
Kau memegang semua kehidupanku
Keluar dari derita
Menuju kedamaian yang Ilahi
Rasanya ingin malam ini
Menciummu hingga lemas
Rasanya ingin malam ini
Memelukmu hingga terlelap
Tuhan tolong segera sadarkan
Aku dari semua
Pengaruh sihir cinta mati
Aku kepadanya
Rasanya ingin malam ini
Menciummu hingga lemas
Rasanya ingin malam ini
Memelukmu hingga terlelap
Ku ingin ini bukan hanya
Sekedar mimpi belaka
Ku ingin ini menjadi
Dosa terindah dalam hidupku"
Manusia Bodoh,ADA Band,"Dahulu terasa indah
Tak ingin lupakan
Bermesraan s'lalu jadi
Satu kenangan manis
Tiada yang salah
Hanya aku, manusia bodoh
Yang biarkan semua
Ini permainkanku berulang-ulang kali
Mencoba bertahan sekuat hati
Layaknya karang yang dihempas sang ombak
Jalani hidup dalam buai belaka
Serahkan cinta tulus di dalam takdir
Tak ayal tingkah lakumu
Buatku putus asa
Kadang akal sehat ini
Tak cukup membendungnya
Hanya kepedihan
Yang s'lalu datang menertawakanku
Dia belahan jiwa
Tega menari indah di atas tangisanku
Mencoba bertahan sekuat hati
Layaknya karang yang dihempas sang ombak
Jalani hidup dalam buai belaka
Serahkan cinta tulus di dalam takdir
Tapi sampai kapankah
Ku harus menanggungnya?
Kutukan cinta ini
Semua kisah pasti ada akhir
Yang harus dilalui
Begitu juga akhir kisah ini
Yakin ku indah
Mencoba bertahan sekuat hati
Layaknya karang yang dihempas sang ombak
Jalani hidup dalam buai belaka
Serahkan cinta tulus di dalam takdir
Tapi sampai kapankah
Ku harus menanggungnya?
Kutukan cinta ini
Bersemayam dalam kalbu
"
All I Ask,Adele,"I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before, you know
So why don't we just play pretend?
Like we're not scared of what's coming next
Or scared of having nothing left
Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?
I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that matters
Tell me who do I run to?
Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?
Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?"
Love In The Dark,Adele,"Take your eyes off of me so I can leave
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never ending, we have been here before
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore
Please, stay where you are
Don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind
I'm being cruel to be kind
I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Baby, we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Everything changed me
You have given me something that I can't live without
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it, all the more that we will fight
Please, don't fall apart
I can't face your breaking heart
I'm trying to be brave
Stop asking me to stay
I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Baby, we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Everything changed me
We're not the only ones, I don't regret a thing
Every word I've said, you know I'll always mean
It is the world to me that you are in my life
But I want to live and not just survive
That's why I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Baby, we're already defeated
'Cause, ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Everything changed me
And I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me"
When We Were Young,Adele,"Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk
To the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home
You're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment?
Before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know
You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God this reminds me, of when we were young
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were scared of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I'd swear you moved overseas
That's what you said, when you left me
You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me, of when we were young
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young
(When we were young)
When we were young
(When we were young)
It's hard to win me back
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care?
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young
When we were young
(When we were young)
When we were young
(When we were young)
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
Oh I'm so mad I'm getting old
It makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young"
Hello,Adele,"Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time
So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs)
Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs)
Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs)
Anymore (lows, lows, lows, lows)
Hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore"
Someone Like You,Adele,"I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things, I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
""Don't forget me, "" I beg
I remember you said
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead""
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead""
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
""Don't forget me, "" I begged
I remember you said
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead""
Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
""Don't forget me, "" I beg
I remember you said
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead""
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
""Don't forget me, "" I begged
I remember you said
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead""
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"""
Don't You Remember,Adele,"When will I see you again?
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal any sins
I had no idea of the state we were in
I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more
When was the last time you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memory?
I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do, the less I know
But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and heaviness in my head
But don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more
Gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free
And hope that you find the missing piece
To bring you back to me
Why don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more
When will I see you again?"
Rolling in the Deep,Adele,"There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)
(Never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall)
(Rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside (you're gonna wish you)
Of your hands (never had met me)
And you played it (tears are gonna fall)
To the beat (rolling in the deep)
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared
The scars of your love (never had met me)
Remind me of us (tears are gonna fall)
They keep me thinking (rolling in the deep)
That we almost had it all (you're gonna wish you)
The scars of your love (never had met me)
They leave me breathless (tears are gonna fall)
I can't help feeling (rolling in the deep)
We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)
(Never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall)
(Rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside (you're gonna wish you)
Of your hands (never had met me)
And you played it (tears are gonna fall)
To the beat (rolling in the deep)
We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating
Throw your soul through every open door (whoa)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (whoa)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (whoa)
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown
We could've had it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)
(Never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall)
(Rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside (you're gonna wish you)
Of your hands (never had met me)
And you played it (tears are gonna fall)
To the beat (rolling in the deep)
Could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)
(Never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall)
(Rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside (you're gonna wish you)
Of your hands (never had met me)
But you played it, you played it, you played it
You played it to the beat"
I Miss You,Adele,"I want every single piece of you
I want your heaven and your oceans too
Treat me soft but touch me cruel
I wanna teach you things you never knew, baby
Bring the floor up to my knees
Let me fall into your gravity
Then kiss me back to life to see
Your body standing over me
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby, give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby, give me light
I love the way your body moves
Towards me from across the room
Brushing past my every groove
No one has me like you do, baby
Bring your heart, I'll bring my soul
But be delicate with my ego
I wanna step into your great unknown
With you and me setting the tone
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby, give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby, give me light
We play so dirty in the dark
'Cause we are living worlds apart
It only makes it harder, baby
It only makes it harder, baby
Harder baby, harder baby
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby, give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby, give me light
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you"
Remedy,Adele,"I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe
Right before my eyes, I saw that my heart, it came to life
This ain't easy, it's not meant to be
Every story has its scars
But when the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be your remedy
No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you
Come whatever, I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through
Your love, it is my truth
And I will always love you
Love you, oh
When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be your remedy, oh
When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
I will be, I will be
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be, I will be
Your remedy, mm-hm, mm-hmm"
Hometown Glory,Adele,"I've been walking in the same way as I did
Missing out the cracks in the pavement
And turning my heel and strutting my feet
""Is there anything I can do for you dear?
Is there anyone I could call?""
""No and thank you, please Madam
I ain't lost, just wandering""
'Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
'Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of now
I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
'Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
'Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met yeah
Do-dily-di-da-da-da-da-day, yeah
Do-dily-di-da-da-da-da-day, yeah
Do-do-do-do-ohh-ohh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, hey, ay
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world
Of my world, yeah
Of my world
Of my world, yeah"
Sweetest Devotion,Adele,"With your loving, there ain't nothing
That I can't adore
The way I'm running, with you, honey
Means we can break every law
I find it funny that you're the only
One I never looked for
There is something in your loving
That tears down my walls
I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to
The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known
I'll forever be whatever you want me to be
I'll go under and all over for your clarity
When you wonder if I'm gonna lose my way home
Just remember, that come whatever, I'll be yours all alone
I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to
The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known
I've been looking for you, baby
In every face that I've ever known
And there is something 'bout the way you love me
That finally feels like home
You're my light, you're my darkness
You're the right kind of madness
And you're my hope, you're my despair
You're my scope, everything, everywhere
The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Devotion"
He Won’t Go,Adele,"Some say, I'll be better without you
But they don't know you like I do
Or at least the sides I thought I knew
I can't bear this time
It drags on, as I lose my mind
Reminded by things I find
Like notes and clothes you left behind
Wake me up, wake me up when all is done
I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity's become undone
But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this ride
What if I lose my heart and fail the climb?
I won't forgive me if I give up trying
I heard his voice today
I didn't know a single word he said
Not one resemblance to the man I met
Just a vague and broken boy instead
But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I-I'm willing to take the risk
There will be times, we'll try and give it up
Bursting at the seams, no doubt
We almost fall apart then burn the pieces
To watch them turn to dust
But nothing will ever taint us
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I-I'm willing to take the risk
Will he, will he still remember me?
Will he still love me even when he's free
Or will he go back to the place where he
Will choose the poison over me?
When we spoke yesterday
He said to hold my breath and sit and wait
""I'll be home so soon, I won't be late""
He won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
He's willing to take the risk
So I won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
'Cause he won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
We're willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk"
Set Fire To The Rain,Adele,"I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name
When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing gets better
'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was
The last time, the last time
Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you
I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time
Oh, oh, no
Let it burn
Oh, oh
Let it burn
Let it burn"
Easy on Me,Adele,"There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washin' my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in
Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose
What I chose to do
So go easy on me
There ain't no room for things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I have tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up
Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
Had no time to choose
What I chose to do
So go easy on me
I had good intentions
And the highest hopes
But I know right now
That probably doesn't even show
Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
I didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose
What I chose to do
So go easy on me"
Oh My God,Adele,"I ain't got too much time to spare
But I'll make time for you to show how much I care
Wish that I would let you break my walls
But I'm still spinning out of control from the fall
Boy, you give good love, I won't lie
It's what keeps me coming back, even though I'm terrified
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Mmh, yeah
Mmh, yeah
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Mmh, yeah
Mmh, yeah
Oh my God, I can't believe it
Out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of jumping
Out of my life and into your arms?
Maybe, baby, I'm just losing my mind
'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of Heaven and Hell
Is a battle that I cannot fight
I'm a fool, but they all think I'm blind
I'd rather be a fool than leave myself behind
I don't have to explain myself to you
I am a grown woman and I do what I want to do
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Mmh, yeah
Mmh, yeah
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Mmh, yeah
Mmh, yeah
Oh my God, I can't believe it
Out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of jumping
Out of my life and into your arms?
Maybe, baby, I'm just losing my mind
'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of Heaven and Hell
Is a battle that I cannot fight
Lord don't let me, I said Lord don't let me
I said Lord don't let me let me down (oh Lord)
Lord don't let me, I said Lord don't let me
I said Lord don't let me let me down (don't let me let myself down)
Lord don't let me, I said Lord don't let me
I said Lord don't let me let me down (oh my God)
Lord don't let me, I said Lord don't let me (oh, oh, oh)
I said Lord don't let me let me down
Oh my God, I can't believe it
Out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of jumping
Out of my life and into your arms?
Maybe, baby, I'm just losing my mind
'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of Heaven and Hell
Well it's a battle that I cannot fight
Lord don't let me, I said Lord don't let me (I know that it's wrong)
I said Lord don't let me let me down (but I want to have fun)
Lord don't let me, I said Lord don't let me (mmh, yeah)
I said Lord don't let me let me down (mmh, yeah)
Lord don't let me, I said Lord don't let me (I know that it's wrong)
I said Lord don't let me let me down (but I want to have fun)
Lord don't let me, I said Lord don't let me (mmh, yeah)
I said Lord don't let me let me down (mmh, yeah)"
Million Years Ago,Adele,"I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly, learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down, I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes, I'd have to pay
And bare my soul
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
A million years ago"
Turning Tables,Adele,"Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
All that I say, you always say more
I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb I can't breathe
So, I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue you to just desert me
I can't give you what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables
Under haunted skies I see you, ooh-ooh
Where love is lost your ghost is found
I braved a hundred storms to leave you
As hard as you try, no I will never be knocked down
I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb I can't breathe
So, I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue you to just desert me
I can't give you what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
Turning tables
Next time I'll be braver
I'll be my own saviour
When the thunder calls for me
Next time I'll be braver
I'll be my own saviour
Standing on my own two feet
I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue you to just desert me
I can't give you what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables
Turning tables, yeah
Oh, no, no"
To Be Loved,Adele,"I built a house for love to grow
I was so young that it was hard to know
I'm as lost now as I was back then
Always make a mess of everything
It's about time that I face myself
All I do is bleed into someone else
Painting walls with all my secret tears
Filling rooms with all my hopes and fears
But oh my, oh my
I'll never learn if I never leap
I'll always yearn if I never speak
To be loved and love at the highest count
Means to lose all the things I can't live without
Let it be known that I will choose to lose
It's a sacrifice but I can't live a lie
Let it be known, let it be known that I tried
I'm so afraid but I'm open wide
I'll be the one to catch myself this time
Trying to learn to lean in to it all
Ain't it funny how the mighty fall?
Looking back I don't regret a thing
Yeah, I took some bad turns that I am owning
I'll stand still and let the storm pass by
Keep my heart safe 'til the time feels right
But oh my, oh my
I'll never learn if I never leap
I'll always yearn if I never speak
To be loved and love at the highest count
Means to lose all the things I can't live without
Let it be known that I will choose to lose
It's a sacrifice but I can't live a lie
Let it be known
Let it be known that I cried for you
Even started lying to you
What a thing to do
All because I wanted
To be loved and love at the highest count
Means to lose all the things I can't live without
Let it be known, known, known
That I will choose, I will lose
It's a sacrifice but I can't live a lie
Let it be known
Let it be known that I tried, that I tried
Let it be known that I tried"
Lovesong,Adele,"Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again
However far away
I will always love you
However long I stay
I will always love you
Whatever words I say
I will always love you
I will always love you
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again
However far away
I will always love you
However long I stay
I will always love you
Whatever words I say
I will always love you
I will always love you
However far away
I will always love you
However long I stay
I will always love you
Whatever words I say
I will always love you
I'll always love you
I'll always love you
'Cause I love you"
Hold On,Adele,"Hold on
You are still strong
Love will soon come
Just hold, hold on
Oh, what have I done yet again?
Have I not learned anything?
I don't want to live in chaos
It's like a ride that I want to get off
It's hard to hold onto who I am
When I'm stumbling in the dark for a hand
I am so tired of battling with myself
With no chance to win
Hold on
Let time be patient
You are still strong
Let pain be gracious
Love will soon come
Just hold, hold on
I swear to God, I am such a mess
The harder that I try, I regress
I'm my own worst enemy
Right now I truly hate being me
Every day feels like the road I'm on
Might just open up and swallow me whole
How do I feel so mighty small
When I'm struggling to feel at all?
Just hold on
Let time be patient (you)
You are still strong
Let pain be gracious
(Love will soon come)
Just hold (you, just hold on, you, just hold on)
Hold on (you, just hold on, just hold on)
Sometimes loneliness is the only rest we get
(Just hold on, just hold on)
And the emptiness actually lets us forget
(Just hold on, just hold on)
Sometimes forgiveness is easiest in secret
(Just hold on, just hold on, just hold on, just hold on)
So just hold on, ooh-ooh
Let time be patient
(You are still strong)
Let pain be gracious
Love will soon come, baby
If you just hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on (hold on)
Just let time be patient (you)
'Cause you're still strong
You're still strong (are still strong)
Just be gracious
Love will soon come
If you just hold on, mm
(You, just hold on, you, just just hold on, you, just hold on)
Just be patient, just be patient (you, just hold on)
You, just hold on, you, just hold on (you are still strong)
You, just hold on
Just hold on, just hold on"
Cry Your Heart Out,Adele,"Cry your heart out, it'll clean your face
When you're in doubt, go at your own pace
Cry your heart out, it'll clean your face
When you're in doubt, go at your own pace
When I walk in a room, I'm invisible
I feel like a ghost
All my friends keep on tellin' me that
This feeling won't last, mm
I can't get no relief, I'm so tired of myself
I swear I'm dead in the eyes
I have nothin' to feel no more, I can't even cry
When will I begin to feel like me again?
I'm hanging by a thread
My skin's paper thin, I can't stop wavering
I've never been more scared
Cry your heart out, it'll clean your face
When you're in doubt, go at your own pace
Cry your heart out, it'll clean your face
When you're in doubt, go at your own pace
When I wake up, I'm afraid of the idea
Of facin' the day
I would rather stay home on my own
Drink it all away
Please stop callin' me, it's exhausting
There's really nothin' left to say
I created this storm, it's only fair I have to sit in its rain
When will I begin to feel like me again?
I'm hanging by a thread
My skin's paper thin, I can't stop wavering
I've never been more scared
Cry your heart out, it'll clean your face
When you're in doubt, go at your own pace
Cry your heart out, it'll clean your face
When you're in doubt, go at your own pace
All love is devout, no feeling is a waste
But keep it to yourself now, before it's too late
In the end it's just you, stop drowning in wait
Your love is useless without it
Cry your heart out (cry, yeah), it'll clean your face
When you're in doubt, go at your own pace"
Bahagia Bersamamu,Adera,"Tiada pernah ku duga kau kan tiba
Menghapus semua luka yang ku rasa
Membiarkan hatimu jatuh di pelukanku
Memaksa nuraniku tuk jatuh cinta
Sudah cukup waktuku mengenalmu
Ku ingin membawamu lebih jauh
Membiarkan asmara bicara sejujurnya
Melabuhkan rindu di antara kita
Hatiku hilang di dasar samudera cinta
Ku temukan kembali saat kau menyinari hidupku
Bagiku kaulah yang membuat dunia indah
Mewarnai hari-hariku sempurnalah jiwaku bahagia bersamamu
Tibalah saatnya bunga cinta bermekaran indah
Menghiasi dunia untuk kita
Mewarnai hari-hariku menerangi malam gelapku
Sempurnalah jiwaku bahagia bersamamu"
Ku Tak Bisa,Adista,"Segala kenangan indah telah 'ku lewati bersamamu
'Ku tak bisa jauh darimu, jangan kau tinggalkanku
Pahit asin manisnya cinta telah 'ku lewati bersamamu
'Ku tak bisa jauh darimu, jangan kau tinggalkanku
Dua kata yang tak pernah bisa 'ku lupa dari dirimu
Kata rayu manis dan manjamu, kekasih
Kau bilang kau takkan pernah tinggalkan diriku
Apapun yang terjadi, apapun yang terjadi
Kau tak pernah berpikir betapa besar cinta ini
Kau buatku terluka, hingga 'ku terjatuh di dalam hatimu
'Ku tak pernah berfikir kau 'kan tinggalkan diri ini
Kau hancurkan diriku, namun engkau jauh tinggalkan diriku
Kini 'ku hanya berharap, berharap dan terus berharap
Kau takkan tinggalkan diriku, jangan kau hancurkanku
'Ku mencintai dirimu, 'ku mohon jangan tinggalkanku
'Ku tak bisa jauh darimu, jangan kau tinggalkanku
Dua kata yang tak pernah bisa 'ku lupa dari dirimu
Kata rayu manis dan manjamu, kekasih
Kau bilang kau takkan pernah tinggalkan diriku
Apapun yang terjadi, apapun yang terjadi
Kau tak pernah berpikir betapa besar cinta ini
Kau buatku terluka, hingga 'ku ter-"
Panah Asmara,Afgansyah Reza,"Berdebar rasa di dada
Setiap kau tatap mataku
Apakah arti pandangan itu menunjukkan hasratmu
Sungguh aku telah tergoda saat kau dekat denganku
Hanya kau yang membuatku begini
Melepas panah asmara
Sudah katakan cinta
Sudah kubilang sayang
Namun kau hanya
Diam tersenyum kepadaku
Kau buat aku bimbang
Kau buat aku gelisah
Ingin rasanya kau jadi milikku
Ku akan setia menunggu
Satu kata yang terucap
Dari isi hati sanubarimu
Yang membuatku bahagia"
Bukan Cinta Biasa,Afgansyah Reza,"Kali ini kusadari
Aku telah jatuh cinta
Dari hatiku terdalam
Sungguh aku cinta padamu
Cintaku bukanlah cinta biasa
Jika kamu yang memiliki
Dan kamu yang temaniku seumur hidupku
Terimalah pengakuanku
Percayalah kepadaku
Semua ini kulakukan
Karena kamu memang untukku
Cintaku bukanlah cinta biasa
Jika kamu yang memiliki
Dan kamu yang temaniku seumur hidupku
Seumur hidupku
Cintaku bukanlah cinta biasa
Jika kamu yang memiliki
Dan kamu yang temaniku seumur hidupku
Cintaku bukan cinta biasa
Jika kamu yang menemani
Dan kamu yang temaniku seumur hidupku
Terimalah pengakuanku"
Sudah,Afgansyah Reza,"Tak perlu kau katakan isi hatimu
Semua telah tersirat di dua matamu
Simpan segala upaya tuk buat ku percaya
Semua baik adanya
Terluka sendiri ku pendam segala rasa
Karena aku tak bisa
Mengharapkan cinta yang
Takkan pernah ada
Sudah kini ku melepaskan
Cinta yang dulu kubanggakan
Aku sadari semua ini
Memang bukan salahmu
Aku tahu
Kamu bukan untukku
Ku kan melupakanmu
Walau tak bisa mudah
Ku kan bertahan sudah
Sudah kini ku melepaskan
Cinta yang dulu kubanggakan
Aku sadari semua ini
Memang bukan salahmu
Aku tahu
Sudah kini ku melepaskan
Cinta yang dulu kubanggakan
Aku sadari semua ini
Memang bukan salahmu
Aku tahu
Kamu bukan untukku"
Sadis,Afgansyah Reza,"Terlalu sadis caramu
Menjadikan diriku
Pelampiasan cintamu
Agar dia kembali padamu
Tanpa perduli sakitnya aku
Tega niannya caramu
Menyingkirkan diriku
Dari percintaan ini
Agar dia kembali padamu
Tanpa perduli sakitnya aku
Semoga Tuhan membalas smua yang terjadi
Kepadaku suatu saat nanti
Hingga kau sadari sesungguhnya yang kau punya
Hanya aku tempatmu kembali
Sebagai cintamu oh
Hanya aku tempatmu kembali
Semoga Tuhan membalas smua yang terjadi
Kepadaku suatu saat nanti
Hingga kau sadari sesungguhnya yang kau punya
Hanya aku tempatmu kembali
Hingga kau sadari sesungguhnya yang kau punya
Hanya aku oh
Sebagai cintamu

Terima Kasih Cinta,Afgansyah Reza,"Tersadar di dalam sepiku
Setelah jauh melangkah
Cahaya kasihmu menuntunku
Kembali dalam dekap tanganmu
Terima kasih cinta untuk segalanya

Kesalahanku yang pernah menyakitimu
Tanpamu tiada berarti
Tak mampu lagi berdiri

Kunci Hati,Afgansyah Reza,"Hmmmmm... hooo...
Teringat pada saat itu
Tertegun lamunanku melihatmu
Tulus senyumanmu, sejenak tenangkan
Hatiku yang telah lama tak menentu
Rasa sepi yang telah sekian lama
Selimuti ruang hati yang kosong
Perlahan t'lah sirna, bersama hangatnya
Kasihmu yang buat ku percaya lagi
Dan ku akui, hanyalah dirimu
Yang bisa merubah segala, sudut pandang gila
Yang kurasakan tentang cinta
Yang selama ini menutup pintu hatiku
Yang kini t'lah kau buka
Disaat ku sudah lelah mencari
Disaat hati ini t'lah terkunci
Kau datang membawa, seberkas harapan
Engkau yang memiliki kunci hatiku oohh
Dan ku akui, hanyalah dirimu
Yang bisa merubah segala, sudut pandang gila
Yang kurasakan tentang cinta
Yang selama ini menutup pintu hatiku
Yang kini t'lah kau buka
Tiada kata yang mampu
Utarakan betapa indah
Ijinkan ku tuk selalu
Berada disampingmu
Dan ku akui, hanyalah dirimu
Yang bisa merubah segala, sudut pandang gila
Yang kurasakan tentang cinta
Yang selama ini menutup pintu hatiku
Yang kini t'lah kau buka
Yang kini t'lah kau... buka...
Uuhhuuuu..."
Percayalah,Afgansyah Reza,"Aku yang tak akan melepaskan
Kamu yang menggenggam hatiku
Kita takkan mungkin terpisahkan
Biarlah terjadi, apapun yang terjadi ... huuu
Aku yang tak bisa melepaskan
Kamu yang miliki hatiku ... Ohh
Walau mungkin terlalu cepat
Bagi kita berdua untuk mengatakan...
Selamanya kita akan bersama
Melewati segalanya
Yang dapat pisahkan kita berdua
Selamanya kita akan bersama
Takkan ada keraguan
Kini dan nanti percayalah
Aku yang tak bisa melepaskan
Kamu yang menggenggam hatiku
Walau mungkin terlalu cepat
Bagi kita berdua untuk mengatakan...
Selamanya kita akan bersama
Melewati segalanya
Yang dapat pisahkan kita berdua
Selamanya kita akan bersama
Takkan ada keraguan
Kini dan nanti percayalah
Hanya dirimu satu-satunya tercipta untukku.
Selamanya kita akan bersama
Takkan ada keraguan kini dan nanti
Percayalah...
Takkan ada keraguan kini dan nanti
Takkan ada keraguan hati tlah memilih

Setia Menunggu,Afgansyah Reza,"Tuhan yang tau
Betapa ku simpan rasaku
Meski ini tak mungkin
Ku bersamamu
Sejak ku putuskan
Menunggu dalam ketidakpastian
Itulah janji hati
Yang siap terluka
Jika cinta harus memilih
Jika jalanku penuh lirih
Aku mencintaimu
Lebih dari apa yang kau tau
Jika memang tak akan mungkin
Jiwa aku menentang takdir
Aku tak salah
Teguhkan niatku
Tuk setia menunggu

Saat ku kenal dirimu
Kita hanya saling bercerita tentang
Ku dengannya kau dengan dia
Mengapa Tuhan pertemukan
Kita yang tak mungkin menyatu
Aku yang tlah terikat janji
Engkau pun begitu
Ku coba lawan aturan yang ada
Tuk terus bersamamu
Semakin ku tenggelam dalam keadaan
Semakin ku menginginkan lebih
Mengapa Tuhan pertemukan

Hamba-Mu yang s'lalu bertakwa

Dalam sunyi aku bersujud

Lagu Cinta Cintaan,Agrikulture,"Hei kawan nyanyikan
Ini lagu cinta
Cinta apa saja
Bisa cinta buta
Bisa cinta monyet jangan main pelet
Bikin doi semakin lengket
Cinta bisa bikin gila bisa bikin awet muda
Cinta dicari dan dipuja nona mari dansa
Berdendang menari berikan cintamu
Semua kan ku beri asal kau di sampingku
Marilah kemari coba bawa cintaku
Damai menyertai kita melangkah maju
Hei kawan dengarkan
Ini masih lagu cinta
Tiap album pasti ada
Lebih gampang mengudara
Dari jaman titik puspa sampai rhoma irama
Sudah tradisi Indonesia
Cerah hari ini bulan bintang matahari
Dan kau tersenyum saat ku genggam jemari
Bunyi genderang datang dan ramaikan
Senyumlah kawan menari bergoyang"
Biar Aku Yang Pergi,Aldi Maldini,"Tak ku sangka
Semua seperti ini
Semua yang indah
Berubah jadi sirna
Tak habis pikir
Kau tega seperti ini
Meninggalkan aku
Tanpa suatu kepastian
Ku hanya bisa berharap
Kau bahagia di sana
Dengan dia pilihanmu
Walau dia sahabatku
Biar aku yang pergi
Biar aku yang tersakiti
Biar aku yang berhenti
Berhenti mengharapkanmu
Oh Tuhan kuatkan aku
Menerima semua ini
Jika dia memang untukku
Kuharap kembalikan dia padaku
Ku hanya bisa berharap
Kau bahagia di sana
Dengan dia pilihanmu
Walau dia sahabatku
Biar aku yang pergi
Biar aku yang tersakiti
Biar aku yang berhenti
Berhenti mengharapkanmu
Oh Tuhan kuatkan aku
Menerima semua ini
Jika dia memang untukku
Kuharap kembalikan dia padaku
Biar aku yang pergi
Biar aku yang tersakiti
Biar aku yang berhenti
Berhenti mengharapkanmu
Oh Tuhan kuatkan aku
Hoo hoo ooo

Kuharap kembalikan dia padaku
Aku yang berhenti

Kuharap kembalikan dia padaku
Oh Tuhan kembalikan dia padaku"

Cinta Luar Biasa,Andmesh Kamaleng,"Waktu pertama kali
Kulihat dirimu hadir
Rasa hati ini inginkan dirimu
Hati tenang mendengar
Suara indah menyapa geloranya hati ini tak ku sangka
Rasa ini tak tertahan
Hati ini selalu untukmu
Terimalah lagu ini dari orang biasa
Tapi cintaku padamu luar biasa
Aku tak punya bunga
Aku tak punya harta
Yang kupunya hanyalah hati yang setia tulus padamu
Hari hari berganti
Kini cintapun hadir
Melihatmu memandangmu bagai bidadari
Lentik indah matamu
Manis senyum bibirmu
Hitam panjang rambutmu anggung terikat
Rasa ini tak tertahan
Hati ini swlalu untukmu
Terimalah lagu ini
Dari orang biasa"
Andaikan Kau Datang,Andmesh Kamaleng,"Terlalu indah dilupakan
Terlalu sedih dikenangkan
Setelah aku jauh berjalan

Jawaban apa yang 'kan kuberi?
Adakah jalan yang kautemui
Untuk kita kembali lagi?

Kumau dia,Andmesh Kamaleng,"Ohh-oo-oo (Kumau dia, aa-ah)
Kuharap semua ini bukan sekedar harapan
Dan juga harapan ini bukan sekedar khayalan
Biarkan ku menjaganya sampai berkerut dan putih rambutnya
Jadi saksi cintaku padanya
Tak main-main hatiku
Apapun rintangannya, kuingin bersama dia
Kumau dia, tak mau yang lain
Hanya dia yang s'lalu ada kala susah dan senangku
Kumau dia, walau banyak perbedaan
Kuingin dia bahagia hanyalah denganku, woo-oo-hu
(Kaulah yang terbaik selalu kuingat)
Biarkan ku menjaganya sampai berkerut
Dan putih rambutnya jadi saksi cintaku padanya
Ho-uu, uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu

Jangan Semudah Ini,Andmesh Kamaleng,"Hu-uh-uh-uh-hu
Hm-mm-mm
Di sini, aku masih termenung
Seakan tiada percaya
Oh, betapa tak dapat kusadari
Kini kau telah pergi tinggalkanku sendiri
Jangan semudah ini
Mengakhiri kasih di antara kita
Jangan secepat ini
Menghapuskan semua yang masih terasa
Di sini aku masih terdiam
Tiada dapat berkata
Oh, betapa masih tak ku mengerti
Bayangmu telah hilang, melayang kian jauh
Jangan semudah ini, oh-wo
Mengakhiri kasih di antara kita
Jangan secepat ini
Menghapuskan semua yang masih terasa
Oh, kupikir masih ada dirimu
Mengisi hari-hariku
Oh, ternyata ku t'lah salah mengira
Hanya khayal dan mimpi
Hu-uh-hu-uh-uh-uh
(Jangan semudah ini) jangan semudah ini
(Mengakhiri kasih di antara kita)
Di antara, di antara kita, ho-oh
Mengakhiri kasih di antara kita
Jangan secepat ini, ho-uh-uh
Menghapuskan semua yang masih terasa
Yang masih terasa"
Putus Tapi Cinta,Andmesh Kamaleng,"Semua cerita, cerita indah
Tentang hubungan kita berdua
Yang lama telah usai, hilang begitu saja
Walaupun sebenarnya masih ada rasa
Hati tak tega, melihat wajahnya
Mencoba sembunyikan luka dengan senyuman
Ketika kukatakan padanya, tak ingin lagi 'tuk bersamanya
Dan ternyata penyesalan pun datang
Aku bodoh t'lah meninggalkanmu
Melepaskanmu dengan alasan ku bosan
Memang putus cinta itu biasa
Yang tak biasa itu, putus tapi masih cinta
Aku mencoba mencari dirinya
Berharap ku bisa kembali dengannya
Namun apa daya, tak bisa apa-apa
Kini dia t'lah bahagia bersama yang lain
Aku bodoh t'lah meninggalkanmu
Melepaskanmu dengan alasan ku bosan
Memang putus cinta itu biasa
Yang tak biasa itu, putus tapi masih cinta
Seandainya masih ada harapan
'Tuk bisa bersama denganmu lagi, huo-oo-oo
Aku bodoh, bodoh, bodoh (putus tapi cinta)
Ho-oo, melepasmu, tinggalkanmu karena bosan
Memang putus cinta itu biasa
Yang tak biasa itu, putus tapi (masih cinta)
Putus tapi masih cinta"
Bisa Tanpamu,Andmesh Kamaleng,"Hu-uh-uh
Akan kubuktikan aku bisa
(Du-du-du-du-du, du-du-du)
Kalau ini memang maumu
Silakan pergi, pergi menjauh dariku
Seharusnya ku tak memulai semua
Semua cerita antara kita
Yang kini tinggal kenangan
Akan kubuktikan bahwa ku bisa tanpamu (aku bisa tanpamu)
Kau memang tercipta bukan 'tuk bersamaku (oh, tapi)
Tapi ingatlah bahwa suatu hari nanti
Takkan kau temukan pada yang lain
Yang sangat mencintaimu lebih dariku
Hari demi hari kulalui sendiri
Tanpa tawamu, tanpa candamu
Tanpa manjamu, ho-oh (ho-oh)
Memang kuakui sulit 'tuk lupakanmu, wo-oh
Namun s'makin lama, s'makin ku terbiasa
Tanpa dirimu, wo-oh
Akan kubuktikan bahwa ku bisa tanpamu (tanpa dirimu)
Kau memang tercipta bukan 'tuk bersamaku, ho-oh
Tapi ingatlah bahwa suatu hari nanti
(Takkan kau) Takkan kau temukan pada yang lain
Yang sangat mencintaimu lebih dariku
Ku bisa tanpamu, oh-ho-oh
Ku bisa tanpamu (aku bisa, aku pasti bisa), oh-uh
Pasti aku 'kan buktikan
Bahwa aku bisa tanpamu, oh
Akan kubuktikan bahwa ku bisa tanpamu
Kau memang tercipta bukan 'tuk bersamaku, uh-oh-uh
Tapi ingatlah bahwa suatu hari nanti
Takkan kau temukan pada yang lain
Yang sangat mencintaimu (lebih dariku) lebih dariku, diriku
Yang sangat mencintaimu
Lebih dariku
"
Senyumlah,Andmesh Kamaleng,"Bila banyak masalah hidupmu
Kuharap dirimu tak usah mengeluh
Percaya dan yakinkan dirimu
Kau bisa mengubah keluh jadi senyum
Tak ada satupun manusia
Yang tak pernah disinggahi masalah
Mungkin inilah cara yang kuasa
Menjadikanmu lebih dari dewasa
Senyumlah syukuri hidupmu
Tunjukkan pada dunia bahwa kau mampu
Masih banyak yang lebih susah hidupnya
Senyumlah syukuri hidupmu
Tak ada satupun manusia
Yang tak pernah disinggahi masalah
Mungkin inilah cara yang kuasa
Menjadikanmu lebih dari dewasa
Senyumlah syukuri hidupmu
Tunjukkan pada dunia bahwa kau mampu
Masih banyak yang lebih susah hidupnya
Senyumlah syukuri hidupmu ho
Bila esok nanti kau sudah lebih baik
Jangan lupakan masa-masa sulitmu
Ceritakan kembali pada dunia
Caramu mengubah keluhmu jadi senyuman
Senyumlah syukuri hidupmu
Tunjukkan pada dunia bahwa kau mampu
Masih banyak yang lebih susah hidupnya
Senyumlah syukuri hidupmu
Syukuri hidupmu
Tunjukkan pada dunia kau mampu
Masih banyak yang lebih susah hidupnya
Senyumlah syukuri hidupmu
Senyumlah syukuri hidupmu

Ego,Andmesh Kamaleng,"Entah sampai kapan
Ku harus bertahan
Mencoba tuk slalu mengerti...dirimu...
Sedangkan hatiku
Tlah lama mengeluh
Seakan memaksa tuk berhenti...denganmu...

Selama hubungan ini

Kau mencintai egomu lebih dariku

Biarkan kurasakan bahagia

Jangan Lupakan Aku,Andmesh Kamaleng,"Uu-uu-uu
Tak sengaja, kita bertemu
Hari-hariku sejalan denganmu
Kau selalu ada saat kubutuh kamu
Kau pergi, ku sendiri
Tak tahu apa yang harus kulakukan tanpamu
Tapi ku tau, hatimu untukku
Kupercaya itu
Ho-oo-oo
Ku disini merindukanmu sangat rindu
Apakah engkau juga begitu oh sayangku
Bukan berarti ku disini meragukanmu
Oh sayangku jangan kau lupakan aku (jangan kau lupakanku)
Hu-uu
Tapi ku tau, hatimu untukku
Kupercaya itu
O-o-oh ...

Sempurna,Andra And The Backbone,"Kau begitu sempurna, dimata ku kau begitu indah

Hanya bersama mu ku akan bisa
Kau adalah darah ku
Kau adalah jantung ku
Kau adalah hidup ku, lengkapi diri ku
Oh sayangku kau begitu
Sempurna, sempurna

Kekasih Bayangan,"Angga Candra
","Padamu pemilik hati yang tak pernah ku miliki
Yang hadir sebagai bagian dari kisah hidupku
Engkau aku cinta dengan segenap rasa di hati
S'lalu ku mencoba menjadi seperti yang engkau minta
Aku tahu engkau, sebenarnya tahu
Tapi kau memilih seolah engkau tak tahu
Kau sembunyikan rasa cintaku
Di balik topeng persahabatanmu yang palsu
Kau jadikan aku kekasih bayangan
Untuk menemani saat kau merasa sepi
Bertahun lamanya kujalani kisah cinta sendiri
Mungkin memang benar
Cinta itu tak lagi berharga
Semua percuma bila engkau tak punya ikatan
Aku tahu engkau sebenarnya tahu
Tapi kau memilih seolah engkau tak tahu
Kau sembunyikan rasa cintaku
Di balik topeng persahabatanmu yang palsu
Kau jadikan aku kekasih bayangan
Untuk menemani saat kau merasa sepi
Bertahun lamanya ku jalani kisah
Cinta sendiri
Cinta sendiri
Ohh
Aku tahu engkau sebenarnya tahu
Tapi kau memilih seolah engkau tak tahu
Kau sembunyikan rasa cintaku
Di balik topeng persahabatanmu yang palsu
Kau jadikan aku kekasih bayangan
Untuk menemani saat kau merasa sepi
Bertahun lamanya kujalani kisah cinta sendiri
Cinta sendiri"
Penjaga Hati,Ari Lasso,"Tak pernah aku impikan
Betapa beratnya meruntuhkan hatimu

Cinta Terakhir,Ari Lasso,"Sedalam samudera telah aku selami
Setinggi langit diangkasa tlah kuarungi
Sepanjang kehidupanku aku mencari
Sebentuk kelembutan hati cinta sejati
Oh kini usai sudah segala penantian panjangku
Setelah temukan dirimu duhai kekasihku
Hanya dihatimu akan kulabuhkan hidupku
Karna kaulah cinta terakhirku
Berjuta kejora terangi gelap malamku
Tetap tak seindah cahaya mata hatimu
Oh kini usai sudah segala penantian panjangku
Setelah temukan dirimu duhai kekasihku
Hanya dihatimu akan kulabuhkan hidupku
Karna kaulah cinta terakhirku
Kini usai sudah segala penantian panjangku
Setelah temukan dirimu duhai kekasihku

Hampa,Ari Lasso,"Kupejamkan mata ini
Mencoba untuk melupakan
Segala kenangan indah
Tentang dirimu, tentang mimpiku
Semakin aku mencoba
Bayangmu semakin nyata
Merasuk hingga ke jiwa
Tuhan, tolonglah diriku
Entah di mana dirimu berada
Hampa terasa hidupku tanpa dirimu
Apakah di sana kau rindukan aku?
Seperti diriku yang s'lalu merindukanmu
Selalu merindukanmu
Tak bisa aku ingkari
Engkaulah satu-satunya
Yang bisa membuat jiwaku
Yang pernah mati menjadi berarti
Namun kini kau menghilang
Bagaikan ditelan bumi
Tak pernahkah kau sadari
Arti cintamu untukku?
Entah di mana dirimu berada
Hampa terasa hidupku tanpa dirimu
Apakah di sana s'lalu rindukan aku?
Seperti diriku yang s'lalu merindukanmu
Selalu merindukanmu
Oh, yeah
Oh-oh, entah di mana dirimu berada
Hampa terasa hidupku tanpa dirimu
Apakah di sana s'lalu rindukan aku?
Seperti diriku yang s'lalu merindukanmu
Selalu merindukanmu
Entah di mana dirimu berada
Hampa terasa hidupku tanpa dirimu
Apakah di sana s'lalu rindukan aku?
Seperti diriku yang s'lalu merindukanmu
Selalu merindukanmu
Entah di mana

Smart money bettin' I'll be better off without you
In no time I'll be forgettin' all about you
You sayin' that you know but I really, really doubt you understand
My life is easy when I ain't around you
Iggy Iggy, too big to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you more than I love your presence
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
No half-stepping, either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listenin' to you knowin' I can't believe what you're sayin'
There's a million yous, baby boo, so don't be dumb
I got 99 problems but you won't be one
Like what
Mm-mm na-na-na (one less, one less problem)
Mm-mm, yeah (one less, one less problem)
Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got
One less problem without ya (hey)
I got one less problem without ya (no, babe)
I got one less problem without ya (ooh, ooh, baby) (I got one less, one less problem)
Problem, problem, problem (I got one less, one less problem, problem)
Hey
I got one less, one less, yeah (I got one less, one less problem)"

Say, I'm thinking 'bout her every second, every hour
Do my singing in the shower
Picking petals off the flowers like
Do she love me, do she love me not? (love me not)
I ain't a player, I just (Player, I just...)
You give me that kind of something
Want it all the time, need it everyday
On a scale of one to ten I'm at a hundred

Then maybe it'd be different
If you spoke I would've listened, but now I'm with somebody else

Baby, and drive me crazy

Why Try,Ariana Grande,"I've been living with devils and angels, angels, angels

We been living like angels and devils, devils

So why do I try?
You drive me insane
Now we're screaming just to see who's louder
So why do I try?
You got me like (na na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na) (oh, yeah)
You and I redefine being lovesick, lovesick, lovesick
Through it all, you could still make my heart skip, heart skip, oh yeah
Even when you're yelling at me
I still think you're beautiful
Through it all you could still make my heart skip, heart skip
I'm loving the pain
I never wanna live without it
So why do I try?
You drive me insane

Best Mistake,Ariana Grande,"How soon do we forget, how we felt?
Dealing with emotions, that never left
Playing with the hand that we were dealt, in this game
Maybe I'm the sinner, and you're the saint
Gotta stop pretending, what we ain't
Why we pointing fingers, anyway?
When we're the same
Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds
And stop acting like we're blind?
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind, boy
You know, I'll be saving my love for you, for you
'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, mm, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on (uh-huh), mm, hold on, eh (yeah)
I guess time's wasting, tick tocking, lip locking
How can we keep the feelings fresh, how do we zip lock it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeves, so watch out for pickpockets
I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it
Hold up, I know love could be a beach with no shore
I done count to ten, lost my temper, and went back to four
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out, started a family tree
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue
You ask why I love your mom so much 'cause she's a older you
I wish that you were happy, I guess that's the one thing I should be providing
Ain't no number twos, we both ones of ones and we the oddest
Couple only humans 'cept you, you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just being honest
When you start as friends, it's hard to say you're never going back
If I'm not the one, then I'm the best mistake you ever had
Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds?
And stop acting like we're blind
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind boy
You know, I'll be saving my love for you, for you
'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, mm, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, mm, hold on, eh
You're, you're, you're, you're
Mmm, I'll be saving my love for you, for you
You're, you're, you're, you're
Mmm, I'll be saving my love for you, for you"

Aku Di Matamu,Armada,"Kita telah berjanji
Untuk tak saling menyakiti
Sulit ku mengerti
Begitu mudahnya kau ingkari
Katakan salahku
Tolong kau jelaskan padaku
Isi di hatimu
Karena ku berhak tahu
Apakah aku sejahat itu di matamu
Sehingga kamu tak mau lagi dekat denganku
Apakah aku seburuk itu di hidupmu
Salahku di mana kau lupakan semua tentang kita
Kita telah berjanji
Untuk tak saling menyakiti
Aku tak mengerti
Alasan engkau pergi
Apakah aku sejahat itu di matamu
Sehingga kamu tak mau lagi dekat denganku
Apakah aku seburuk itu di hidupmu
Salahku di mana
Kau lupakan semua tentang kita
Apakah aku sejahat itu di matamu
Sehingga kamu tak mau lagi dekat denganku
Apakah aku seburuk itu di hidupmu
Salahku di mana tapi tak mengapa
Ku selalu berdoa kau bahagia"
Perjalanan Cinta (Terima Kasih Sayang),Armand Maulana and Dewi Gita,"Kan ku katakan dengan lantang
Biar semua gugusan bintang
Mendengar hatiku hanya mau kamu
Kubisikkan pada udara
Merangkaikan dalam aksara
Mengisahkan opera kita berdua
Pastinya dalam perjalanan kita
Banyak salahku dan salahmu
Dan itu jadi penguat kita
Kamu yang tahu aku
Curangku dan nakalku
Jujurku dan tulusku
Rinduku dan bosanku
Terima kasih sayang
Berjuta musim merata
Kau dan aku jadi kita
Sampai menutup mata
Terima kasih sayang"

Tak bisa lagi begini
Teman tapi cinta
Aku ingin menyatakan perasaan hatiku
Aku ingin memiliki dirimu cintamu
Jangan ragukan aku
Jangan kau tunda aku
Pacar terbaik untukmu
Tak sabar lagi
Memilikimu dengan sesungguhnya
Tak tahan lagi begini
Menanti jawaban
Aku pacar terbaik untukmu
Yang paling mencinta kamu"
Cintanya Aku,Arsy Widianto,"Tergetar aku tepat di hadapanmu
Debar jantungku berdetak saat kugenggam tanganmu
Beruntung aku kini dapatkan cintamu
Yang tercantik di hatiku sejak awal ku bertemu
Janji padaku jangan kau lukai
Hati seperti kisah yang lalu
Kau bukan cinta pertamaku
Namun aku berharap
Mulai hari ini saat ini
Engkau cintanya aku
Yang kurasakan denganmu semua berbeda
Kekasih yang baik hati kini ada di sampingku
Janji padaku jangan ada lagi
Hati yang lain selain aku"
Rindu dalam hati,Arsy Widianto,"Kadang hati
Berharap kuterbangun dari sebuah mimpi
Ini bukan kenyataan
Namun adanya tak ada di sini
Kau meninggalkanku karena kesalahanku
Mungkin ingin bertemu masih ada
Ingin memeluk masih ada
Sayang kini tak bisa
Kau telah memilihnya oh
Mungkin saat hatiku masih sayang
Salahku memutus cinta
Dan kini kumenyesal
Rindu hanya di dalam hati
Andaikan aku
Tak tergesa memutuskanmu
Karena egoku hati ini tak akan begini
Setiap ingat dirimu rasanya ingin kembali
Mungkin ingin bertemu masih ada
Ingin memeluk masih ada
Sayang kini tak bisa
Kau telah memilihnya oh
Mungkin saat hatiku masih sayang
Salahku memutus cinta
Dan kini kumenyesal
Rindu hanya di dalam hati
Ingin memutar waktu
Ingin mengulang lagi
Aku tak bisa berpaling lagi
Begitu juga aku
Jauh di relung hati
Sungguh tak mampu tuk berpindah cinta
Ho
Mungkin ingin bertemu masih ada
Ingin memeluk masih ada
Sayang kini tak bisa
Kau telah memilihnya oh
Mungkin saat hatiku masih sayang
Salahku memutus cinta
Dan kini kumenyesal
Rindu hanya di dalam hati
Nana
Sayang kini tak bisa
Kau telah memilihnya oh
Mungkin saat hatiku masih sayang
Salahku memutus cinta dan kini kumenyesal
Rindu hanya di dalam hati
Rindu hanya di dalam hati
Di hati kau tetap terindah
Selalu di hati"

Ternyata Salah Mengenalmu,Asbak Band,"Kau pernah bilang
Aku yang terdalam
Kau simpan di dalam hatimu
Kau juga bilang
Di hembus nafasmu
Selalu kau sebut namaku
Tapi mengapa kau tinggalkan aku
Di saat aku butuh
Terlalu indah yang pernah kau bilang
Ternyata salah ku mengenalmu
Lupakan aku
Jelas kau permainkan ku
Aku tak mengapa
Ku biasa saja
Walau sedikit terluka
Lupakan aku
Banyak yang lebih darimu
Yang tak hanya bisa
Cuma bilang cinta
Dan manis di bibir saja

Aku Bukan Dia,Asbak Band,"Apa gunanya diriku menjadi kekasihmu
Bila kau kerap mengingat masa lalumu
Bahagia kah dirimu dengan masa lalumu
Tapi mengapa kau memilih aku
Jangan salahkan diriku nanti bosan denganmu
Bila kau terus membandingkan diriku
Jadi setengah hati cintaku kepadamu
Atau mungkinku meninggalkan kamu
Hargai aku jaga perasaanku
Aku bukan dia dia bukan diriku
Aku punya cara untuk bahagiakanmu
Maaf ku tak bisa jadi seperti dia
Jangan salahkan diriku nanti bosan denganmu
Bila terus membandingkan diriku
Jadi setengah hati cintaku kepadamu
Atau mungkinku meninggalkan kamu
Maafkan aku bila menyakitimu
Buka maksudku membandingkan dirimu
Ho o aku punya cara untuk bahagiakanmu
Maaf ku tak bisa jadi seperti dia
Hargai aku jaga perasaanku
Aku bukan dia dia bukan diriku
Aku punya cara untuk bahagiakanmu

Sungguh Aku Rindu,Asbak Band,"Tak mungkinku temui
Cinta seperti kamu
Datang dari hati kecilmu
Hanya untuk diriku
Dan kiniku mengerti
Setelah engkau pergi
Baru aku sadari kamu
Berarti dalam hidupku
Aku ingin kau kembali memeluk diriku
Kan ku katakan kepadamu sungguh aku rindu
Tak bisa aku tanpamu ada di sisiku
Sungguhku tahu bahwa aku sangat mencintaimu
Dan kiniku mengerti
Setelah engkau pergi
Baru aku sadari kamu
Berarti dalam hidupku
Aku ingin kau kembali memeluk diriku
Kan ku katakan kepadamu sungguh aku rindu
Tak bisa aku tanpamu ada di sisiku
Sungguhku tahu bahwa aku sangat mencintaimu
Aku ingin kau kembali memeluk diriku
Kan ku katakan kepadamu sungguh aku rindu
Tak bisa aku tanpamu ada di sisiku
Sungguhku tahu bahwa aku sangat mencintaimu
Aku ingin kau kembali memeluk diriku
Kan ku katakan kepadamu sungguh aku rindu"
Masih Adakah,Asbak Band,"Rasa sakit mengajariku
Untuk lebih memahamimu
Walau kau tak pernah tahu
Betapa hancurnya aku
Telah lama kurasakan yang tak biasa
Tak seperti yang dulu pernah kurasakan
Mengapa kini berubah?
Masih adakah cinta untukku
Di dalam hatimu
Yang dahulu hanya untukku?
Seandainya ada yang lain
Di dalam hatimu
Jujur saja, ku tak bisa
Kita akhiri saja
Telah lama kurasakan yang tak biasa
Tak seperti yang dulu pernah kurasakan
Mengapa kini berubah?
Masih adakah cinta untukku
Di dalam hatimu
Yang dahulu hanya untukku?
Seandainya ada yang lain
Di dalam hatimu
Jujur saja, ku tak bisa
Kita akhiri saja
Ho-oh, masih adakah cinta untukku
Di dalam hatimu
Yang dahulu hanya untukku?
Seandainya ada yang lain
Di dalam hatimu
Jujur saja, ku tak bisa (ku tak bisa)
Kita akhiri saja"
Menguras Hati,Asbak Band,"Apa gunanya memberi cinta
Bila akhirnya berdusta
Manisnya hanya di bibir saja
Namun hatiku terluka
Apa artinya memberi hati
Bila untuk disakiti
Cinta berubah menjadi benci
Harus bagaimana lagi
Cintamu menguras hati
Terlalu sering kau bagi
Jika nanti aku pergi
Janganlah kau sesali
Apa artinya memberi hati
Bila untuk disakiti
Cinta berubah menjadi benci
Harus bagaimana lagi
Bila kau tahu isi hatiku
Yang sesungguhnya untukmu
Sampai hatimu setega itu
Mempermainkan diriku uwo
Cintamu menguras hati
Terlalu sering kau bagi
Jika nanti aku pergi
Janganlah kau sesali
Cintamu mengiris hati
Terlalu dalam dan perih
Ku rasa tak baik lagi
Untuk dijalani oh
Cintamu menguras hati
Terlalu sering kau bagi
Jika nanti aku pergi
Janganlah kau sesali
Cintamu mengiris hati
Terlalu dalam dan perih
Ku rasa tak baik lagi
Untuk dijalani
Hu oh"
Hanya Kamu,Ayu Ting Ting,"Aku ada tapi seperti
Tak ada saat kau tak ada di sisiku
Karena kamulah gemintang
Yang hinggapi setiap malam
Kau terangi gelapku
Apa aku tanpa kamu, tak ada tujuan
Sebab hanya kamu pelita hatiku
Cintaku akan selalu tertuju padamu
Kuseberangi samudra hanya untuk bersamamu
Jurang yang membentang antara kau dan aku
Takkan melebihi cintaku kepadamu
Dua hati menjadi satu, melintasi semua batasan
Kau untukku, untuk kamu
Biarkan waktu yang menempa kemurniaan ikatan kita
Abadilah cinta kita
Eetaplah menjadi dirimu
Cukup itu bahagiaku
Biarkan cinta kita yang bicara
Menyatakan pada dunia"
lovely,Billie Eilish,"Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out (found)
But you never go away (never go away)
So I guess I gotta stay now
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home
Walkin' out of time
Lookin' for a better place (lookin' for a better place)
Something's on my mind (mind)
Always in my head space
But I know some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home
Whoa, yeah
Yeah, ah
Whoa, whoa
Hello, welcome home"
bad guy,Billie Eilish,"White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm the bad guy
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at being bad, bad
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne
I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad"
when the party's over,Billie Eilish,"Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'
Quiet when I'm comin' home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend but keep me closer (call me back)
And I'll call you when the party's over
Quiet when I'm comin' home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go
Quiet when I'm comin' home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that"
i love you,Billie Eilish,"It's not true
Tell me I've been lied to
Cryin' isn't like you
Ooh
What the hell did I do?
Never been the type to
Let someone see right through
Ooh
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothin' has to change today
You didn't mean to say, ""I love you""
I love you and I don't want to
Ooh
Up all night on another red eye
I wish we never learned to fly
I
Maybe we should just try
To tell ourselves a good lie
I didn't mean to make you cry
I
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothin' has to change today
You didn't mean to say, ""I love you""
I love you and I don't want to
Ooh
The smile that you gave me
Even when you felt like dyin'
We fall apart as it gets dark
I'm in your arms in Central Park
There's nothin' you could do or say
I can't escape the way I love you
I don't want to, but I love you
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh"
Bored,Billie Eilish,"Ah
Ah
The games you played were never fun (mm)
You'd say you'd stay but then you'd run (ah)
Givin' you what you're beggin' for
Givin' you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Givin' you what you're beggin' for
Givin' you what you say I need
Say I need
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teachin' me to live without it
Bored
I'm so bored
I'm so bored
So bored
I'm home alone, you're God-knows-where (mm)
I hope you don't think that shit's fair (ah)
Givin' you all you want and more
Givin' you every piece of me
I don't want love I can't afford
I just want you to love for free
Can't you see that I'm gettin' bored?
Givin' you every piece of me
Piece of me
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teachin' me to live without it
Bored
I'm so bored
I'm so bored
So bored

And when you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teachin' me to live without it"
8,Billie Eilish,"Wait a minute, let me finish
I know you don't care
But can you listen?
I came committed, guess I overdid it
Wore my heart out on a chain
Around my neck, but now it's missing, hmm
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
So I think I better go
I never really know how to please you
You're lookin' at me like I'm see-through
I guess I'm gonna go
I just never know how you feel
Do you even feel anything?
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
You said, ""Don't treat me badly""
But you said it so sadly
So I did the best I could
Not thinking you would have left me gladly
I know you're not sorry
Why should you be?
'Cause who am I to be in love
When your love never is for me?
Me
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
So I think I better go
I never really know how to please you
You're lookin' at me like I'm see-through
I guess I'm gonna go
I just never know how you feel
Do you even feel anything?"
COPYCAT,Billie Eilish,"Don't be cautious, don't be kind
You committed, I'm your crime
Push my button anytime
You got your finger on the trigger
But your trigger finger's mine
Silver dollar, golden flame
Dirty water, poison rain
Perfect murder, take your aim
I don't belong to anyone
But everybody knows my name
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say, are all the same things I did
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamor
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine
Call me calloused, call me cold
You're italic, I'm in bold
Call me cocky, watch your tone
You better love me, 'cause you're just a clone
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamor
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine
Mine
I would hate to see you go
Hate to be the one that told you so
You just crossed the line
You've run out of time
I'm so sorry, now you know
Sorry I'm the one that told you so
Sorry, sorry, I'm sorry, sorry
Psych
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamor
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine"
bury a friend,Billie Eilish,"Billie...
What do you want from me?
Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering?
What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me?
Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
Come here...
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly?
You're payin'?
Is the amount cleanin' you out
Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about
The things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ahh-ha)
Cannibal class, killin' the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna–
What do you want from me?
Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering?
What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me?
Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
Listen...
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art
And make you a star and get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park
I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start
That you'd fall apart 'cause I'm too expensive
Your talk'll be somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Callin' security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury your friend right now
For the debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful...
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh-ha)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ahh-ha)
Cannibal class, killin' the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna–
What do you want from me?
Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering?
What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me?
Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?"
Ocean Eyes,Billie Eilish,"I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you gimme those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
I've been walkin' through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you gimme those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
Da, da-da, da-da
Da-da-da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da-da-da-da
Mm
Mm
Mm
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you gimme those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes"
idontwannabeyouanymore,Billie Eilish,"Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Got a mood that you wish you could sell
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told ""a tight dress is what makes you a whore""
If ""I love you"" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you, anymore
Hand, hands getting cold
Losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistake
Only you know the way that I break
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told ""a tight dress is what makes you a whore""
If ""I love you"" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I-I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you, anymore"
TV,Billie Eilish,"I don't wanna talk right now
I just wanna watch TV
I'll stay in the pool and drown
So I don't have to watch you leave
I put on Survivor just to watch somebody suffer
Maybe I should get some sleep
Sinking in the sofa while they all betray each other
What's the point of anything?
All of my friends are missing again
That's what happens when you fall in love
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
You tell yourself it's fine, you're just in love
Don't know where you are right now
Did you see me on TV?
I'll try not to starve myself
Just because you're mad at me
And I'll be in denial for at least a little while
What about the plans we made?
The internet's gone wild watching movie stars on trial
While they're overturning Roe v. Wade
Now all of my friends are missing again
'Cause that's what happens when you fall in love
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
And you tell yourself it's fine, you're just in love
And I don't get along with anyone
Maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Baby, I, baby, I, baby, I'm the problem
Baby, I, baby, I, baby, I'm the problem
Baby, I, baby, I, baby, I'm the problem
Baby, I, baby, I, baby, I'm the problem
Baby, I, baby, I, baby, I'm the problem"
Therefore I Am,Billie Eilish,"I'm not your friend or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore I am
Stop, what the hell are you talking about? Ha
Get my pretty name outta your mouth
We are not the same with or without
Don't talk 'bout me like how you might know how I feel
Top of the world, but your world isn't real
Your world's an ideal
So, go have fun
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know
I'm not your friend or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore I am
I'm not your friend or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore I am
I don't want press to put your name next to mine
We're on different lines, so I
Wanna be nice enough
They don't call my bluff 'cause I hate to find
Articles, articles, articles
Rather you remain unremarkable
(Got a lotta) interviews, interviews, interviews
When they say your name, I just act confused
Did you have fun?
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know
I'm not your friend or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm sorry
I don't think I caught your name
I'm sorry
I don't think I caught your name
I'm not your friend or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend or anything, damn
You think that you're the man

My Strange Addiction,Billie Eilish,"No, Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died
There's a whole crowd of people out there who need to learn how to do the Scarn
Don't ask questions you don't wanna know
Learned my lesson way too long ago
To be talkin' to you, belladonna
Shoulda taken a break, not an oxford comma
Take what I want when I wanna
And I want ya
Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you're the fuse
Just add some friction
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction
I'm really, really sorry
I think I was just relieved to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back
Yeah, Michael, the movie's amazing
It's like, one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life
Deadly fever, please don't ever break
Be my reliever 'cause I don't self medicate
And it burns like a gin and I like it
Put your lips on my skin and you might ignite it
Hurts, but I know how to hide it, kinda like it
Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you're the fuse
Just add some friction
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction
Bite my glass, set myself on fire
Can't you tell I'm crass?
Can't you tell I'm wired?
Tell me nothin' lasts
Like I don't know
You could kiss my askin' about my motto
You should enter it in festivals
Or carnivals
Thoughts?
Pretty good reaction
Pretty cool, right?
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction
Did you like it? Did you like that?
Um, which part?"
NDA,Billie Eilish,"Did you think I'd show up in a limousine? No
Had to save my money for security
Got a stalker walking up and down the street
Says he's Satan and he'd like to meet
I bought a secret house when I was 17
Haven't had a party since I got the keys
Had a pretty boy over, but he couldn't stay
On his way out, made him sign an NDA
Yeah, I made him sign an NDA
Once was good enough
'Cause I don't want him having shit to say
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no
I can crave you, but you don't need to know
30 Under 30 for another year
I can barely go outside, I think I hate it here
Maybe I should think about a new career
Somewhere in Kauai where I can disappear
I've been having fun, getting older now
Didn't change my number, made him shut his mouth
At least I gave him something he can cry about
I thought about my future, but I want it now
Want it now
You can't give me up
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no
I can crave you, but you don't need to know
Did I take it too far?
Now I know what you are
You hit me so hard
I saw stars
Think I took it too far
When I sold you my heart
How'd it get so dark?
I saw stars
Stars"
"The 30th
",Billie Eilish,"Sometimes, you look the same
Just like you did before the accident
When you're staring into space
It's hard to believe you don't remember it
Woke up in the ambulance
You pieced it all together on the drive
I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you, even then you looked so pretty
In a hospital bed
I remember you said you were scared
And so was I
In a stand-still on The Five, thought it was unusually early traffic
Usually, I don't panic, I just wanted to be on time
When I saw the ambulances on the shoulder, I didn't even think of pulling over
I pieced it all together late that night
And I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you, even then you looked so pretty
In a hospital bed
I remember you said you were scared
And so was I
What if it happened to you on a different day?
On a bridge, where there wasn't a rail in the way?
Or a neighborhood street where the little kids play?
Or the Angeles Crest in the snow or the rain?
What if you weren't alone? There were kids in the car
What if you were remote? No one knows where you are
If you changed anything, would you not have survived?
You're alive, you're alive, you're alive
And I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you, even then you looked so pretty
In your hospital bed
I remember you said you were scared
And so am I"
wish you were gay,Billie Eilish,"""Baby, I don't feel so good"", six words you never understood
""I'll never let you go"", five words you'll never say (aww)
I laugh along like nothing's wrong, four days has never felt so long
If three's a crowd and two was us, one slipped away (hahahahaha)
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
Is there a reason we're not through?
Is there a 12-step just for you?
Our conversation's all in blue
11 ""heys"" (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ten fingers tearin' out my hair
Nine times, you never made it there
I ate alone at seven, you were six minutes away
How am I supposed to make you feel okay
When all you do is walk the other way?
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
To spare my pride
To give your lack of interest, an explanation
Don't say I'm not your type
Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation
I'm so selfish
But you make me feel helpless, yeah
And I can't stand another day
Stand another day
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way, hmm
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay"
watch,Billie Eilish,"Lips meet teeth and tongue
My heart skips eight beats at once
If we were meant to be
We would have been by now
See what you wanna see
But all I see is him right now
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out
Your love feels so fake
And my demands aren't high to make
If I could get to sleep
I would have slept by now
Your lies will never keep
I think you need to blow 'em out
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out
When you call my name
Do you think I'll come runnin'?
You never did the same
So good at givin' me nothin'
When you close your eyes, do you picture me?
When you fantasize, am I your fantasy?
Now you know
Now I'm free
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out
Never let you back
Let you back, let you back
Never gonna let you back, let you back"
All the Good Girls Go to Hell,Billie Eilish,"My Lucifer is lonely
Standing there, killing time
Can't commit to anything but a crime
Peter's on vacation, an open invitation
Animals, evidence
Pearly gates look more like a picket fence
Once you get inside 'em
Got friends but can't invite them
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya
All the good girls go to hell
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And heaven's out of sight
She'll want the devil on her team
My Lucifer is lonely
Look at you needing me
You know I'm not your friend without some greenery
Walk in wearing fetters
Peter should know better
Your cover up is caving in
Man is such a fool
Why are we saving him?
Poisoning themselves now
Begging for our help, wow!
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya
All the good girls go to hell
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And heaven's out of sight
She'll want the devil on her team
My Lucifer is lonely
There's nothing left to save now
My god is gonna owe me
There's nothing left to save now"
My Boy,Billie Eilish,"Three and four and
Ba, ba, da
Ba, ba, da, ba, da, da
Mmm
My boy's being sus, he was shady enough
But now he's just a shadow
My boy loves his friends like I love my split ends
And by that I mean
He cuts 'em off
(What?)
My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest
My boy's being sus and he don't know how to cuss
He just sounds like he's tryna be his father (who are you?)
My boy's an ugly crier but he's such a pretty liar
And by that I mean he said he'd change
My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest
My boy, my, my boy, my friends
I love, love, I, I love, love my split ends
My boy
My, my boy, my boy
(Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love)
(Alright dude, go trip over a knife)
My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest
You want me to be yours, well, then you gotta be mine
And if you want a good girl, then goodbye
You want me to be yours, well, then you gotta be mine
And if you want a good girl, then goodbye"
Lost Cause,Billie Eilish,"Something's in the-
Something's in the air right now
Like I'm losing track of time
Like I don't really care right now, but maybe that's fine
You weren't even there that day
I was waitin' on you
I wondered if you aware that day was the last straw for me and I know
I sent you flowers
Did you even care?
You ran the shower and left them by the stairs
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay, ay
Thought you had your shit together, but damn, I was wrong
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause
And this ain't nothin' like it once was
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause
And this ain't nothin' like it oncе was
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job
I used to think you were shy
But maybe you just had nothing on your mind
Maybe you were thinkin' 'bout yourself all the time
I used to wish you were mine
But that was way before I realized
Someone like you would always be so easy to find
So easy (so easy)
He-hee, mm-mm-mm, mm
Gave me no flowers
Wish I didn't care
You'd been gone for hours
Could be anywhere
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Thought you would've grown eventually, but you proved me wrong
You ain't nothing but a lost cause
And this ain't nothing like it once was
I know you think you're such an outlaw (yeah)
But you got no job
You ain't nothing but a lost cause
And this ain't nothing like it once was
I know you think you're such an outlaw (think you're such an outlaw)
But you got no job
What did I tell you?
Don't get complacent
It's time to face it now, na-na, na-na, na-na
What did I tell you?
Don't get complacent
It's time to face it now, na-na-na"
Listen Before I Go,Billie Eilish,"Take me to the rooftop
I wanna see the world when I stop breathing
Turning blue
Tell me, love is endless, don't be so pretentious
Leave me, like you do (like you do)
If you need me
Wanna see me
Better hurry
'Cause I'm leaving soon
Sorry, can't save me now
Sorry, I don't know how
Sorry, there's no way out (sorry)
But down, mm down
Taste me, the salty tears on my cheek
That's what a year-long headache does to you
I'm not okay, I feel so scattered
Don't say I'm all that matters
Leave me
Deja vu
If you need me
Wanna see me
You better hurry
I'm leaving soon
Sorry, can't save me now
Sorry, I don't know how (sorry)
Sorry, there's no way out (sorry)
But down, mm down
Call my friends and tell
Them that I love them
And I'll miss them
But I'm not sorry
Call my friends and tell them that I love them
And I'll miss them
Sorry"
Your Power,Billie Eilish,"Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But having it's so strange
She said you were a hero, you played the part
But you ruined her in a year, don't act like it was hard
And you swear you didn't know (didn't know)
No wonder why you didn't ask
She was sleeping in your clothes (in your clothes)
But now she's got to get to class
How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad when they find out?
If you could take it all back, would you?
Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But having it's so strange
I thought that I was special, you made me feel
Like it was my fault you were the devil, lost your appeal
Does it keep you in control? (In control)
For you to keep her in a cage?
And you swear you didn't know (didn't know)
You said you thought she was your age
How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad if it turns out
That they kill your contract?
Would you?
Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But power isn't pain
Mmm
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, hmm"
Getting Older,Billie Eilish,"I'm getting older, I think I'm aging well
I wish someone had told me I'd be doing this by myself
There's reasons that I'm thankful, there's a lot I'm grateful for
But it's different when a stranger's always waiting at your door
Which is ironic 'cause the strangers seem to want me more
Than anyone before (anyone before)
Too bad they're usually deranged
Last week, I realized I crave pity
When I retell a story, I make everything sound worse
Can't shake the feeling that I'm just bad at healing
And maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed
Which is ironic because when I wasn't honest, I was still being ignored
(Lying for attention just to get neglection)
Now we're estranged
Things I once enjoyed (ah-ah)
Just keep me employed now
Things I'm longing for
Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weird
That we care so much until we don't
I'm getting older, I've got more on my shoulders
But I'm getting better at admitting when I'm wrong
I'm happier than ever, at least that's my endeavor
To keep myself together and prioritize my pleasure
'Cause to be honest, I just wish that what I promise
Would depend on what I'm given (not on his permission)
(Wasn't my decision) to be abused, mmm
Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now
Things I'm longing for, mmh
Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weird
That we care so much until we don't
But next week, I hope I'm somewhere laughing
For anybody asking, I promise I'll be fine
I've had some trauma, did things I didn't wanna
Was too afraid to tell ya, but now, I think it's time"
Talking to the Moon,Bruno Mars,"I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away
I want you back, I want you back
My neighbors think I'm crazy
But they don't understand
You're all I had, you're all I had
At night, when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself
Talking to the moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
Oh-oh
I'm feeling like I'm famous, the talk of the town
They say I've gone mad
Yeah, I've gone mad
But they don't know what I know
'Cause when the sun goes down, someone's talking back
Yeah, they're talking back, oh
At night, when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself
Talking to the moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Do you ever hear me calling?
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah) oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
'Cause every night, I'm talking to the moon
Still trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
Oh-oh
I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away"
Runaway Baby,Bruno Mars,"Ah, yes
Check it out
Well, looky here, looky here, ah, what do we have?
Another pretty thing ready for me to grab
But little does she know that I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing
'Cause at the end of the night, it is her I'll be holding
I love you so (hey)
That's what you'll say (that's what you'll say)
You'll tell me baby, baby, please don't go away (don't go away)
But when I play, I never stay (but when I play, I never stay)
So every girl that I meet, yeah, this is what I say:
Run, run, run away, run away, baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get, get, get away, get away, darling
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause Lord knows I'm a rolling stone
So you better run, run, run away, run away, baby
Uh
Ah, yeah
Well, let me think, let me think, ah, what should I do?
So many eager young bunnies that I'd like to pursue
Now even though they're eating out the palm of my hand
There's only one carrot and they all gotta share it
I love you so (hey)
That's what you'll say (that's what you'll say)
You'll tell me baby, baby, please don't go away (don't go away)
But when I play, I never stay (but when I play, I never stay)
So every girl that I meet, yeah, this is what I say:
Run, run, run away, run away, baby

See, I ain't tryna hurt you, baby
No, no, no, I just want to work you baby, yuh, yuh
See, I ain't tryna hurt you baby
No, no, no, I just want to work you baby
If you're scared, you better run (you better run)
You better run (you better run)
You better run (you better run)
You better, you better, you better
Run, run, run away, run away, baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get, get, get away, get away, darling
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause Lord knows I'm a rolling stone
So you better run, run, run away, run away, baby"

When I Was Your Man,Bruno Mars,"Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
It all just sounds like ooh, ooh, ooh, hoo
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man
My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like ooh, ooh, ooh, hoo
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man"
That's What I Like,Bruno Mars,"Ayy, ayy, ayy
I got a condo in Manhattan
Baby girl, what's happenin'? (What's happenin'?)
You and your ass invited
So go on and get to clappin' (clap)
Go pop it for a player, pop-pop it for me
Turn around and drop it for a player (drop it)
Drop-drop it for me (drop it)
I'll rent a beach house in Miami ('ami)
Wake up with no jammies (nope)

Just the Way You Are,Bruno Mars,"Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, ""Do I look okay?""
I say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah
Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
Oh, you know, you know
You know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searchin' for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother askin' if you look okay
You know I'll say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while

I bet my old man will be so proud of me
But sorry pops, you'll just have to wait

Tolong (Ku Sudah Bosan Sendirian),Budi Doremi,"Ku rasa ku sedang jatuh cinta
Karena rasanya ini berbeda
Oh apakah ini memang cinta
Selalu berbeda saat menatapnya
Mengapa aku begini
hilang berani dekat dengan mu
Ingin aku memilikimu
tapi aku tak tahu
Bagaimana caranya
Tolong katakan pada dirinya
Lagu ini kutuliskan untuknya
Nama yang selalu ku sebut dalam doa
Sampai aku mampu
Ucap maukah denganku?
Disini aku berdiri
menanti waktu yang tepat
hingga akhirnya ku mampu
Katakan padamu
Nama yang selalu ku sebut dalam doa
Mungkinkah dia tahu
Cinta yang ku mau
Bagaimana bisa bila punya cinta
Dalam hatimu aku tak tahu
Meski kau bernyanyi
aku tak mengerti
Entah sampai kapan menunggu harapan
Tolong beriku kepastian
Tolong beriku kasih sayang
Ku sudah bosan sendirian"
Melukis Senja,Budi Doremi,"Aku mengerti perjalanan hidup yang kini kau lalui
Ku berharap meski berat kau tak merasa sendiri
Kau telah berjuang menaklukankan hari-hari mu yang tak mudah
Biar ku menemanimu membasuh lelah mu
Izinkan ku lukis senja
Mengukir namamu di sana
Mendengar kamu bercerita
Menangis tertawa
Biar ku lukis malam
Bawa kamu bintang-bintang
Tuk temanimu yang terluka
Hingga kau bahagia
Aku disini walau letih coba lagi jangan berhenti
Ku berharap meski berat kau tak merasa sendiri
Kau telah berjuang menaklukankan hari-hari mu yang tak indah
Biar ku menemanimu membasuh lelah mu
Izinkan ku lukis senja
Mengukir namamu di sana
Mendengar kamu bercerita
Menangis tertawa
Biar ku lukis malam
Bawa kamu bintang-bintang
Tuk temanimu yang terluka
Hingga kau bahagia hah
Izinkan ku lukis senja
Mengukir namamu di sana
Mendengar kamu bercerita
Menangis tertawa
Biar ku lukis malam
Bawa kamu bintang-bintang
Tuk temanimu yang terluka
Hingga kau bahagia
Tuk temanimu yang terluka
Hingga kau bahagia"
Mesin Waktu,Budi Doremi,"Kalau harus ku mengingatmu lagi
Aku takkan sanggup dengan yang terjadi pada kita
Jika melupakanmu hal yang mudah
Ini takkan berat, takkan membuat hatiku lelah
Kalah, kuakui aku kalah
Cinta ini pahit dan tak harus memiliki
Jika aku bisa, ku akan kembali
Ku akan merubah takdir cinta yang kupilih
Meskipun tak mungkin, walaupun ku mau
Membawa kamu lewat mesin waktu
Jika melupakanmu hal yang mudah
Ini takkan berat, takkan membuat hatiku lelah
Panjang perjalanan yang harus kulalui
Merelakanmu
Jika aku bisa, ku akan kembali
Ku akan merubah takdir cinta yang kupilih
Meskipun tak mungkin, walaupun ku mau
Membawa kamu lewat mesin waktu, ho-uh-oh
Wo-uh-oh
Jika aku bisa, ku akan kembali
Ku akan merubah takdir cinta yang kupilih
Meskipun tak mungkin, walaupun ku mau
Membawa kamu, oh-oh
Jika aku bisa, ku akan kembali
Ku akan merubah takdir cinta yang kupilih
Meskipun tak mungkin, walaupun ku mau
Membawa kamu lewat mesin waktu"
Cinta Sejati,Bunga Citra Lestari,"Manakala hati
Menggeliat mengusik renungan
Mengulang kenangan
Saat cinta menemui cinta
Suara semalam
Dan siang seakan berlagu
Dapat aku dengar
Rindumu memanggil namaku
Saat aku tak lagi di sisimu
Kutunggu kau di keabadian
Aku tak pernah pergi
Selalu ada di hatimu
Kau tak pernah jauh
Selalu ada di dalam hatiku
Sukmaku berteriak
Menegaskan kucinta padamu
Terima kasih pada Mahacinta
Menyatukan kita
Saat aku tak lagi di sisimu
Kutunggu kau di keabadian
Cinta kita melukiskan sejarah
Menggelarkan cerita penuh sukacita
Sehingga siapa pun insan Tuhan pasti tahu
Cinta kita sejati
Lembah yang berwarna
Membentuk melekuk memeluk kita
Dua jiwa yang melebur jadi satu
Dalam kesucian cinta"
Karena Kucinta Kau,Bunga Citra Lestari,"Jika ada yang bilang ku lupa kau
Jangan kau dengar
Jika ada yang bilang ku tak setia
Jangan kau dengar
Banyak cinta yang datang mendekat
Ku menolak
Semua itu karena ku cinta kau
Saat kau ingat aku, ku ingat kau
Saat kau rindu, aku juga rasa
Ku tahu, kau selalu ingin denganku
Kulakukan yang terbaik, yang bisa kulakukan
Tuhan yang tahu ku cinta kau
Jika kau tak percaya padaku
Sakitnya aku
Jika kau lebih dengar mereka
Sedih hatiku"
Shameless,Camila Cabello,"Don't speak, no, don't try
It's been a secret for the longest time
Don't run (oh), no, don't hide
Been running from it for the longest time
So many mornings, I woke up confused
In my dreams, I do anything I want to you
My emotions are naked, they're taking me out of my mind
Right now, I'm shameless
Screamin' my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
Show me you're shameless
Write it on my neck, why don't ya?
And I won't erase it
I need you more than I want to
I need you more than I want to
No, uh, uh, don't wanna do this now
No, uh, uh, don't wanna do this now
No, uh, uh, don't wanna do this now
No, uh, uh, don't wanna do this now
So we're there, now it's real
Now that you have me, do you want me still?
My kisses are history, they go back a long time, uh
And I'm tired of loving somebody that's not mine, no
So many mornings I woke up confused
In my dreams, I do anything I want to you
My emotions are naked, they're taking me out of my mind (mind)
Right now, I'm shameless
Screamin' my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
Show me you're shameless
Write it on my neck, why don't ya?
And I won't erase it
I need you more than I want to
I need you more than I want to
No, uh, uh, don't wanna do this now
No, uh, uh, don't wanna do this now
No, uh, uh, don't wanna do this now
No, uh, uh, don't wanna do this now
There's just inches in between us
I want you to give in, I want you to give in, oh
There is tension in between us
I just wanna give in
And I don't care if I'm forgiven
Right now, I'm shameless
Screamin' my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
Show me you're shameless
Write it on my neck, why don't ya?
And I won't erase it
I need you more than I want to
I need you more than I want to
No, uh, uh, don't wanna do this now
No, uh, uh, don't wanna do this now
No, uh, uh, don't wanna do this now

First Man,Camila Cabello,"Yes I'm gonna stay with him tonight
I'll see you in the mornin'
No of course, he won't drink and drive
Can you say bye to mom for me?
Oh you'll like him, he's really kind
And he's funny like you sometimes
And I found someone I really like
Maybe for the first time
No I don't need a jacket
It's not that cold tonight
And you worry, I get it
But he's waiting outside
I swear on my heart
That he's a good man
I know you'll stay up late
Just waiting for me
You held me so tight
Now someone else can
But you were the first man that really loved me
Now you're driving to the airport
Not just me you pick up anymore
I've got eight days off coming up
And I can only come home for four
Yeah I just met his family
They're just like you and mom
He makes me really happy
I think he might be the one, oh
I swear on my heart
That he's a good man
I promise he loves me
He'd never hurt me
You held me so tight
Now someone else can
But you were the first man that really loved me
Now you're on the driveway
Faking a smile
You wish you could tell him he doesn't deserve me
So I had to stop the car and turn around
To tell you, you were the first man that really loved me
And before they open up the doors
I say I've never seen you cry before
You say ""You've never looked so beautiful
You know you'll always be my little girl""
You're looking at me, while walking down the aisle
With tears in your eyes, maybe he deserves me
You don't even know how much it means to me now
That you were the first man that really loved me, that really loved me
You really love me"
OMG,Camila Cabello,"Baby, what'cha say?

"Consequences
",Camila Cabello,"Dirty tissues, trust issues
Glasses on the sink, they didn't fix you
Lonely pillows in a strangers bed
Little voices in my head
Secret keeping, stop the bleeding
Lost a little weight because I wasn't eating
All the songs that I can't listen to, to tell the truth
Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences
Hesitation, awkward conversation
Running on low expectation
Every siren that I was ignoring
I'm payin' for it
Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences
No, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Said, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Hey, no ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Loving you was dumb, dark and cheap
Loving you will still take shots at me
Found loving you was sunshine, but then it poured
And I lost so much more than my senses
'Cause loving you had consequences"

Where would I be? You're all that I need, my world, baby, you hold me down

Never Be the Same,Camila Cabello,"Something must've gone wrong in my brain
Got your chemicals all in my veins
Feeling all the highs, feeling all the pain

Now I'm seeing red, not thinking straight
Blurring all the lines, you intoxicate me
Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need
Yeah, you're all I need
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same
It's you, babe

Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never, ever, ever be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
Sneaking in L.A. when the lights are low
Off of one touch, I could overdose
You said, ""Stop playing it safe, girl""
""I wanna see you lose control""

All I need

Señorita,Camila Cabello,"I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh, la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name, la-la-la
It felt like ooh, la-la-la
Yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la-la-la
It felt like ooh, la-la-la, yeah
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh, la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh, la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
Locked in the hotel
There's just some things that never change
You say we're just friends
But friends don't know the way you taste, la-la-la
'Cause you know it's been a long time coming
Don't you let me fall, oh
Ooh, when your lips undress me
Hooked on your tongue
Ooh, love, your kiss is deadly
Don't stop
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh, la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la

All along I've been coming for ya (for ya)
And I hope it meant something to ya (ooh)
Call my name, I'll be coming for ya
Coming for ya, coming for ya, coming for ya
For ya
For ya (oh, she loves it when I call)
For ya
Ooh, I should be running

Living Proof,Camila Cabello,"Ooh
Tell me something, but say it with your hands slow
When you touch me, paint me like a Van Gogh
I wanna study every inch of you
'Til you trust me to make the angels come through
Like a choir singing, ""Hallelujah""
When my body's crashin' right into ya
When we align, ooh yeah
Do you feel me?
Can you feel me?
'Cause I can't breathe
Where did you come from, baby?
And were you sent to save me? Ooh
There's God in every move, ooh
And you're the living proof (oh)
The way your hands can't shake me
Soft to the touch like baby, ooh
There's God in every move, ooh

Countin' freckles, as they run down your spine
Show your demons, and I might show you mine
One at a time, yeah, yeah

Crying in the Club,Camila Cabello,"You think, that you'll die without him
You know, that's a lie that you tell yourself
You fear, that you'll lay alone forever now
It ain't true, ain't true, ain't true, no
So put your arms around me tonight
Let the music lift you up
Like you've never been so high
Open up your heart to me

Real Friends,Camila Cabello,"No, I think I'll stay in tonight
Skip the conversations and the ""Oh, I'm fines""
No, I'm no stranger to surprise
This paper town has let me down too many times
Why do I even try? Give me a reason why
I thought that I could trust you, never mind
Why all the switching sides? Where do I draw the line?
I guess I'm too naive to read the signs
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
Every time I let somebody in
Then I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Wonder where they're all hidin' out
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Gotta get up out of this town
Oh, oh
Oh, ah
I stay up, talkin' to the moon
Been feelin' so alone in every crowded room
Can't help but feel like something's wrong, yeah
'Cause the place I'm livin' in just doesn't feel like home
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
Every time I let somebody in
Then I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Wonder where they're all hidin' out
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Gotta get up out of this town
Lookin' for some new friends
Oh, oh
Oh, ah
I just wanna talk about nothin'
With somebody that means somethin'
Spell the names of all our dreams and demons
For the times that I don't understand
Tell me what's the point of a moon like this
When I'm alone again
Can I run away to somewhere beautiful
Where nobody knows my name?
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
And I let somebody in
But I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Gotta get up out of this town, yeah
Oh, oh
Oh, ah"
Something’s Gotta Give,Camila Cabello,"Loving you, I thought I couldn't get no higher
Your November rain could set the night on fire
Night on fire
But we could only burn so long
Counterfeit emotions only run skin deep
Know you're lying, when you're lying next to me
Next to me
How did we get so far gone?
I should know by now
You should know by now
We should know by now
Something's gotta give
Something's gotta break
But all I do is give
And all you do is take
Something's gotta change
But I know that it won't
No reason to stay is a good reason to go
Is a good reason to go, oh-oh, mmh-mmm
I have never heard a silence quite so loud
I walk in the room and you don't make a sound
Make a sound
You're good at making me feel small
If it doesn't hurt me, why do I still cry?
If it didn't kill me, then I'm half alive
Half alive
How did we get so far gone?
I should know by now
You should know by now
We should know by now
Something's gotta give
Something's gotta break
But all I do is give
And all you do is take
Something's gotta change
But I know that it won't
No reason to stay is a good reason to go
Is a good reason to go
I should know by now
You should know by now
I think I'm breaking right now
I should know by now
You should know by now
I think I'm breaking right now
Something's gotta give
Something's gotta break
All I do is give
And all you do is take
Something's gotta change (Something's gotta change)

No reason to stay is a good reason to go
Is a good reason to go
Something's gotta give"
She Loves Control,Camila Cabello,"Cold, 'cause she has been here before
She doesn't cry anymore, no looking back
No, she doesn't go to the bar
Too many lovers she scarred
And they want her back
She loves control, she wants it her way
And there's no way she'll ever stay unless you give it up
She loves control, she wants it her way
And all it takes is just one taste, you wanna give it up
Bold, you know she lives for the thrill
You know she lusts for the kill
So they won't come back
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Don't, don't you try taming the storm
Don't say you haven't been warned
'Cause she won't like that, like that
'Cause she loves control, she wants it her way
And there's no way she'll ever stay unless you give it up
She loves control, she wants it her way
And all it takes is just one taste, you wanna give it up
She loves control
She loves control
Say what you want
But the way she kills you, makes you feel alive
And you know that it feels right
She loves control, she wants it her way
And there's no way she'll ever stay unless you give it up
She loves control, she wants it her way
And all it takes is just one taste, you wanna give it up
She loves control
She loves, she loves
She loves, she loves
You know that she loves it, she can't live without it, no
Control, hey"
Feel It Twice,Camila Cabello,"Oh-oh
Oh, I'm scared if I look in your eyes
I might see your soul
I know love is the loneliest place
When you fall alone
Sitting by the phone, holding onto hope
Spending all night wondering, why you let me go?
I wish you had felt how you're feeling two years ago
Oh, nah
Hurts me to hurt you, baby
Lying awake and everything has changed
Keeping our distance lately
Kills me to kill you when I tell you
That I felt it once, I can't feel it twice
It's more than I can take, babe
Hurts me to tell you I don't feel the same
I can feel you still staring at me when I look away
Can't imagine the pain that you feel when I kiss his face
That's when you said
How can I be your friend?
When I know the way you taste?
It's almost 2 a.m
And I can't ask you to stay
I don't know what's worse, getting broken
Or making it break, oh
Hurts me to hurt you, baby
Lying awake and everything has changed
Keeping our distance lately
Kills me to kill you when I tell you
That I felt it once, I can't feel it twice
It's more than I can take, baby
Hurts me to tell you I don't feel the same
Hurts me to hurt you, babe
Feels like there's nothing that I can say
Hurts me to hurt you, babe
Kills me I have to walk away
'Cause I felt it once, I can't feel it twice
It's more than I can take, babe
Hurts me to tell you I don't feel the same
The same, oh, oh
The same, oh
The same, oh, oh
The same
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh"
Easy,Camila Cabello,"You tell me that I'm complicated
And that might be an understatement
Anything else? (Huh-huh-huh-huh-huh)
You tell me that I'm indecisive
Fickle, but I try to hide it
Anything else? (Huh-huh-huh-huh-huh)
You tell me that I overthink
'Til I ruin a good thing
Anything else? (Huh-huh-huh-huh-huh)
You tell me that you'd rather fight
Than spend a single peaceful night
With somebody else (huh-huh-huh-huh)
You really, really know me
The future and the old me
All of the mazes and the madness in my mind
You really, really love me
You know me and you love me
And it's the kind of thing I always hoped I'd find (yeah)
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy
Touch me 'til I find myself in a feeling
Tell me with your hands that you're never leaving (no)
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy (seem so easy)
I never liked my crooked teeth
You tell me they're your favourite thing (mm-hmm)
Anything else? (Huh-huh-huh-huh-huh)
The stretch marks all around my thighs
Kiss 'em 'til I change my mind
About everything else (huh-huh-huh-huh)
You really, really know me
The future and the old me
All of the mazes and the madness in my mind
You really, really love me
You know me and you love me
And it's the kind of thing I always hoped I'd find
Always thought I was hard to love

Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy
Touch me 'til I find myself, in a feeling
Tell me with your hands that you're never leaving
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy
All I know is you, heal me when I'm broken
Heal me when I'm broken, oh
All I know is you saved me and you know it
Saved me and you know it
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy
I always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy ('til you made it, 'til you made it)
Touch me 'til I find myself, in a feeling
Tell me with your hands that you're never leaving
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy"
Bad Kind of Butterflies,Camila Cabello,"Come here and sit next to me
Don't look at me while I'm breaking
After what I'm gonna say
I understand if you hate me
What do I do when I love you and want somebody else?
What do I lose if I don't choose and keep it to myself?
I got bad, bad, bad kind of butterflies
Like when you got something to hide
Lies, tellin' you that I'm alright
Tonight, tonight
Bad, bad butterflies in my chest
There's something I gotta confess
Yes, somebody's stuck in my head
And I, and I
I know I said we were friends
And when I said that I meant it (swear I meant it)
Somewhere between now and then
It became more than just a friendship, mm
What do I do when I love you and want somebody else?
What do I lose if I don't choose and keep it to myself?

Tonight, tonight
Bad, bad butterflies in my chest
There's something I gotta confess
Yes, somebody's stuck in my head
And I, and I
Come here and sit next to me
You tell me, ""Baby, just say it""
Warnin' me, it's a mistake
I just know I gotta make it

Bad, bad, bad kind of butterflies

Lies, tellin' you that I'm alright

This Love,Camila Cabello,"Nah, nah, nah
Know just how to make me miss ya
When I'm feeling sentimental
Going in our separate ways

Losing you I couldn't face

Waiting for ya just in case one day it doesn't hurt
Nah, nah, nah
Said it's the last time
But nah, nah, nah, nah
Just like the last time

Then make it okay
I guess that's your just game
And I'm the one who gets played
Again, and again, and again, and again
Maybe you should set me free
Maybe I don't really want you to
Maybe I just wanna be
Be the person that you just can't lose
If you're gonna leave, then go

Dream Of You,Camila Cabello,"He's a bad dancer

When it's him and I
And you squeeze my hands
Two times, three times
And believe me I'll love you always, always
All I do, the whole day through

Used To This,Camila Cabello,"No, I never liked San Francisco
Never thought it was nothing special
'Til you kissed me there
No, I never liked windy cities
But I think maybe when you're with me
I like everywhere
it's the strangest feeling
Midnight, I'm not leaving
No, for once, I think I'll stay (oh)
I say your name, just listen
Doesn't it sound different?
Never whispered it this way
It's gonna take me a minute
But I could get used to this
The feeling of your fingertips
The feeling of another kiss
It's gonna take me a minute (oh)
But I could get used to this (oh)
Like every tattoo on your skin
I'm memorizing every inch
I could get used to this (oh, oh, oh, oh)
I could get used to this
Definitely
No, I never did like tequila
But there's somethin' 'bout when I see ya
Think I need a drink
And the calluses on your fingers
I admired them from a distance
Now they're on my cheek
Oh, I've known you forever
Now I know you better
Let's just get carried away, oh
And it bears repeating
Now my heart's bleeding
When you tell me that you'll stay
It's gonna take me a minute
But I could get used to this
The feeling of your fingertips
The feeling of another kiss
It's gonna take me a minute

Kala Cinta Menggoda,Chrisye,"Sejak jumpa kita pertama, kulangsung jatuh cinta
Walau kutahu kau ada pemiliknya
Tapi ku tak dapat membohongi hati nurani
ku tak dapat menghindari gejolak cinta ini
Maka izinkanlah aku mencintaimu
Atau bolehkanlah aku sekadar sayang padamu
Maka izinkanlah aku mencintaimu
Atau bolehkanlah aku sekadar sayang padamu
Memang serba salah rasanya tertusuk panah cinta
Apalagi aku juga ada pemiliknya
Tapi ku tak mampu membohongi hati nurani
ku tak mampu menghindari gejolak cinta ini
Maka maafkan jika aku mencintaimu
Atau biarkan ku mengharap kau sayang padaku
Maka maafkan jika aku mencintaimu
Atau biarkan ku mengharap kau sayang padaku"
Cinta Yang Lain,Chrisye,"Janganlah pernah kau harapkan aku
Untuk dapat mencintai dirimu
Coba renungkan dalam hati kita
Perpisahanlah yang mungkin terbaik
Lupakan aku
Jangan pernah kau harapkan cinta
Yang indah dariku
Lupakan aku
Ku punya cinta lain yang tak bisa
Untuk kutinggalkan
Mungkin suatu saat nanti
Kau pun akan mengerti
Bahwa cinta memang tak mesti harus bersama"

When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink and love's a drug
Oh, now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river, dried up
You came to rain a flood
You said, ""Drink from me, drink from me""
When I was so thirsty
Pour on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Pour on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

Yellow,Coldplay,"Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow
I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called Yellow
So then I took my turn
Oh, what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow
Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
And you know, you know I love you so

Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listened as the crowd would sing,
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know St. Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh [5x]

Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know St. Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world"
Paradise,Coldplay,"When she was just a girl she expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep
Dreamed of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes
When she was just a girl she expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear a waterfall
In the night the stormy night she'll close her eyes
In the night the stormy night away she'd fly
Dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
She'd dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Sing, la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
And so lying underneath those stormy skies
She'd say, ""oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I know the sun must set to rise""
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh, oh
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
This could be para, be paradise
Para-paradise
Para-paradise
This could be para, be paradise
Para-paradise
Para-paradise"
Clocks,Coldplay,"The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh, I beg, I beg and plead
Singin' come out of things un said
Shoot an apple off my head
And a trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singin'
You are
You are
Confusion that never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks
Gonna come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know
Singin' come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities
Am I a part of the cure
Or am I part of the disease? Singin'
You are
You are
You are
You are
You are
You are
And nothing else compares
Oh, no, nothing else compares
And nothing else compares
You are
You are

Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home, home, where I wanted to go"
Daddy,Coldplay,"Daddy, are you out there?
Daddy, won't you come and play?
Daddy, do you not care?
Is there nothing that you want to say?
I know
You're hurting, too
But I need you, I do
Daddy, if you're out there
Daddy, all I wanna say
You're so far away
Oh, you're so far away
That's okay
That's okay
I'm okay
Daddy, are you out there?
Daddy, why'd you run away?
Daddy, are you okay?
Look Dad, we got the same hair
And Daddy, it's my birthday
And all I want to say
Is you're so far away
Oh, you're so far away
That's okay
That's okay
That's okay
You're so far away
Won't you come and won't you stay?
Please, stay
Oh, please, stay
Won't you come and won't you stay?
One day
Just one day"
Sparks,Coldplay,"Did I drive you away?
I know what you'll say
You say, ""Oh, sing one we know""
But I promise you this
I'll always look out for you
Yeah, that's what I'll do
I say, ""Ohh""
I say, ""Ohh""
My heart is yours
It's you that I hold on to
Yeah, that's what I do
And I know, I was wrong
But I won't let you down
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I will, yes, I will
I said, ""Ohh""
I cry, ""Ohh""
Yeah, I saw sparks
Yeah, I saw sparks
And I saw sparks

Sing it out"
In My Place,Coldplay,"In My Place, In My Place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh yeah
I was lost, I was lost
Crossed lines I shouldn't have crossed
I was lost, oh yeah
Yeah
How long must you wait for it?
Yeah
How long must you pay for it?
Yeah
How long must you wait for it?
Oh, for it
I was scared, I was scared
Tired and under prepared
But I'll wait for it
If you go, if you go
Leave me down here on my own
Then I'll wait for you (yeah)
Yeah
How long must you wait for it?
Yeah
How long must you pay for it?
Yeah
How long must you wait for it?
Oh, for it?
Singing please, please, please
Come back and sing to me
To me, me
Come on and sing it out
Now, now
Come on and sing it out
To me, me
Come back and sing
In My Place, In My Place
Were lines that I couldn't change
And I was lost, oh yeah

Speed of Sound,Coldplay,"Where to, where do I go?
If you never try, then you'll never know
How long do I have to climb
Up on the side of this mountain of mine?
Look up, I look up at night
Planets are moving at the speed of light
Climb up, up in the trees
Every chance that you get
Is a chance you seize
How long am I gonna stand
With my head stuck under the sand?
I'll start before I can stop
Before I see things the right way up
All that noise, and all that sound
All those places I got found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand
Ideas that you'll never find
All the inventors could never design
The buildings that you put up
Japan and China all lit up
The sign that I couldn't read
Or a light that I couldn't see
Some things you have to believe
But others are puzzles, puzzling me
All that noise, and all that sound
All those places I got found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand
Ah, when you see it then you'll understand
All those signs, I knew what they meant
Some things you can invent
And some get made, and some get sent
Ooh
Birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand
Ah, when you see it then you'll understand"
Up&Up,Coldplay,"Fixing up a car to drive in it again
Searching for the water hoping for the rain
Up and up, up and up
Down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
Waiting for a chance to pick your orange field
Up and up, up and up
See a pearl form, a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood
It's in your blood, it's in your blood
Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
""Sitting with the poison takes away the pain""
Up and up, up and up it's saying
We're gonna get it, get it together, I know
I'm gonna get it, get it together somehow
We're gonna get it, get it together and flower
Woah, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We're gonna get it, get it together I know
We're gonna get it, get it together and flow
I'm gonna get it, get it together and go
Up and up and up
Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
Up and up, up and up
How come people suffer, how come people part?
How come people struggle, how come people break your heart?
Break your heart, oh-oh
Yes I want to grow, yes I want to feel
Yes I want to know, show me how to heal it up
Heal it up
See the forest there in every seed
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed
Just need love just need love
When the going is rough, saying
We're gonna get it, get it together, I know
I'm gonna get it, get it together somehow
We're gonna get it, get it together and flower
Woah, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We're gonna get it, get it together I know
We're gonna get it, get it together and flow
I'm gonna get it, get it together and go
And you can say what is, or fight for it
Close your mind or take a risk
You can say it's mine and clench your fist
Or see each sunrise as a gift
We're gonna get it, get it together, I know
I'm gonna get it, get it together somehow
We're gonna get it, get it together and flower
Woah, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We're gonna get it, get it together I know
We're gonna get it, get it together and flow
I'm gonna get it, get it together and go
Up and up and up
We're gonna get it, get it together, I know
I'm gonna get it, get it together somehow
We're gonna get it, get it together and flower
Woah, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We're gonna get it, get it together I know
We're gonna get it, get it together and flow
I'm gonna get it, get it together and go
Up and up and up
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Fixing up a car to drive in it again
When you're in pain
When you think you've had enough
Don't ever give up
Don't ever give up"
Christmas Lights,Coldplay,"Christmas night
Another fight
Tears we cried a flood
Got all kinds of poison in
Of poison in my blood
I took my feet to Oxford street
Trying to right a wrong
""Just walk away"" those windows say
But I can't believe she's gone
When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Up above candles on air flicker
Oh, they flicker, and they flow
And I'm up here holding onto
All those chandeliers of hope
And like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Singing how I always loved you, darling
And I always will
Oh, when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone
Oh, Christmas lights keep shining on
Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Maybe they'll bring her back to me
And then all my troubles will be gone
Oh, Christmas lights keep shining on
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, Christmas lights
Light up the street
Light up the fireworks in me
May all your troubles soon be gone
Those Christmas lights keep shining on"
Always in My Head,Coldplay,"I think of you
I haven't slept
I think, I do
But, I don't forget
My body moves
Goes where I will
But though I try my heart stays still
It never moves
Just won't be led
And so my mouth waters, to be fed
And you're always in my head
You're always in my head
You're always in my head
You're always in my head
You're always in my head
Always in my head
Always in my...
This, I guess
Is to tell you, you're chosen out from the rest"
Midnight,Coldplay,"In the darkness before the dawn
In the swirling of this storm
When I'm rolling with the punches and hope is gone
Leave a light, a light on
Millions of miles from home
In the swirling swimming on
When I'm rolling with the thunder but bleed from thorns
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on
In the darkness before the dawn
In the darkness before the dawn
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on

Gravity,Coldplay,"Baby
It's been a long time coming
Such a long, long time
And I can't stop running
Such a long, long time
Can you hear my heart beating
Can you hear that sound?
'Cause I can't help thinking
And I won't stop now
And then I looked up at the sun and I could see
Oh, the way that gravity pulls on you and me
And then I looked up at the sky and saw the sun
And the way that gravity pushes on everyone
On everyone
Baby
When your wheels stop turning
And you feel let down
And it seems like troubles
Have come all around
I can hear your heart beating
I can hear that sound
But I can't help thinking
And I won't look now
And then I looked up at the sun and I could see
Oh, the way that gravity pulls on you and me
And then I looked up at the sky and saw the sun
And the way that gravity pushes on everyone
On everyone
On everyone
On everyone
On everyone
On everyone"
Magic,Coldplay,"Call it magic
Call it true
I call it magic
When I'm with you
And I just got broken
Broken into two
Still I call it magic
When I'm next to you
And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't
No, I don't, it's true
No, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't

Want anybody else but you
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Call it magic
Cut me into two
And with all your magic
I disappear from view
And I can't get over
Can't get over you
Still I call it magic
Such a precious jewel
And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't
No, I don't, it's true

And if you were to ask me
After all that we've been through

Of course, I do"
Don't Panic,Coldplay,"Bones, sinking like stones

The Scientist,Coldplay,"Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start
Running in circles, coming up tails
Heads on a science apart
Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start
I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
But tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
Oh and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are
Nobody said it was easy
Oh, it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start"
Biutyful,Coldplay,"All I know is I love you so
I hope that you get everything you want in this beautiful life
Change for your pocket, someone for the night
I hope they name you a rocket, take you for a ride for free
And if they tell you you're nothing, maybe you'd explain
To me you're the summer sun after the rain
You were there when I needed something for the pain, you see
When you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
I'm nowhere else
I'm on top of the world, man
On top of the world
And it's so beautiful
And you're so beautiful
I hope that you get everything you want in this beautiful life
Watermelon moon, so happy you're alive
And I feel like a river finally arrived at sea
'Cause when you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
I know I'll be on top of the world, man
On top of the world
And it's so beautiful
And you're so beautiful

Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall,Coldplay,"I turn the music up
I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight
Maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beatin' to my favorite song
And all the kids they dance
All the kids all night
Until Monday mornin' feels another life
I turn the music up
I'm on a roll this time
And heaven is in sight
I turn the music up
I got my records on
From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop
Maybe I'm in the black
Maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart
As we saw, woah, this light
I swear you, emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls
Every siren is a symphony
And every tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall, oh
Is a waterfall, oh-oh-oh
Is a, is a waterfall
Every tear
Is a waterfall, oh-oh-oh
So you can hurt
Hurt me bad
But still I'll raise the flag
Ooh
It was a wa-wa-wa-wa-waterfall
A wa-wa-wa-wa-waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall"

Aku pun takut kehilangan dirimu
Ingatkah satu bait kenangan cerita cinta kita
Tak mungkin terlupa
Buang semua angan mulukmu itu percaya takdir kita

Visiting Hours,Ed Sheeran,"I wish that heaven had visiting hours
So I could just show up and bring the news
That she's gettin' older and I wish that you'd met her
The things that she'll learn from me, I got them all from you
Can I just stay a while and we'll put all the world to rights?
The little ones will grow and I'll still drink your favorite wine
And soon, they're going to close, but I'll see you another day
So much has changed since you've been away
I wish that heaven had visiting hours
So I could just swing by and ask your advice
What would you do in my situation? I haven't a clue how I'd even raise them
What would you do? 'Cause you always do what's right
Can we just talk a while until my worries disappear?
I'd tell you that I'm scared of turnin' out a failure
You'd say, ""Remember that the answer's in the love that we create""
So much has changed since you've been away
I wish that heaven had visiting hours
And I would ask them if I could take you home
But I know what they'd say, that it's for the best
So I will live life the way you taught me, and make it on my own
And I will close the door, but I will open up my heart
And everyone I love will know exactly who you are
'Cause this is not goodbye, it is just 'til we meet again
So much has changed since you've been away"
Make It Rain,Ed Sheeran,"Oh
When the sins of my father
Weigh down in my soul
And the pain of my mother
Will not let me go
Well, I know there can come fire from the sky
To refine the purest of kings
And even though
I know this fire brings me pain
Even so
And just the same
Make it rain
Make it rain down, Lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, Lord
Make it rain
Make it rain
Oh, the seed needs the water
'Fore it grows out of the ground
But it just keeps on getting hard
And hunger more profound
Well, I know they can't count tears from the eye
But they may as well all be in vain
And even though I know these tears come with pain
Even so
And just the same
Make it rain
Make it rain down, Lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, Lord
Just make it rain
Make it rain
Well, the seas are full of water
Stops by the shore
Just like the riches of grandeur
Oh, no, no
That never reach the poor
And let the clouds fill with thunderous applause
And let lightning be the veins
And fill the sky, with all that they can draw
When it's time, to make a change
Make it rain
Make it rain down, Lord
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, Lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain

All of the Stars,Ed Sheeran,"It's just another night, and I'm staring at the moon
I saw a shooting star and thought of you
I sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you
You're on the other side as the skyline splits in two
Miles away from seeing you
But I can see the stars from America
I wonder, do you see them too?
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home
I can hear your heart on the radio beat
They're playing, ""Chasing Cars"", and I thought of us
Back to the time you were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand, back through lamp-lit streets I knew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars over Amsterdam?
You're the song my heart is beating to
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home
And oh
And you know
And oh
I can see the stars from America"
Happier,Ed Sheeran,"Walking down 29th and Park
I saw you in another's arms
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said somethin' to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're movin' on with someone new
'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle
And telling myself you're happier, aren't you?
(Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, hey, yeah)
Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you (hey, yeah, hey, yeah)
But ain't nobody need you like I do (hey, yeah, hey, yeah)
I know that there's others that deserve you (hey, yeah, hey, yeah)
But my darlin', I am still in love with you
But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
'Cause baby, you look happier, you do
I knew one day you'd fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I'll be waitin' here for you"
Galway Girl,Ed Sheeran,"She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Cèilidh singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet
A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl

My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

Supermarket Flowers,Ed Sheeran,"I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, ""Don't you cry when you're down""
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink
Oh I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah
You're home
Fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face
I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah
You're home
Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back he said Hallelujah
You're home"

Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
Well, I found a man, stronger than anyone I know
He shares my dreams, I hope that someday we'll share a home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be your girl, you'll be my man
And I see my future in your eyes
Well, baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, while listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms

Thinking Out Loud,Ed Sheeran,"When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen
Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are, oh
So baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
Baby, you burn so hot
You make me shiver with the fire you got
This thing we started, I don't want it to stop
You know you make me shiver-er-er
Baby, you burn so hot
You make me shiver with the fire you got
This thing we started, I don't want it to stop
You know you make me shiver
Yeah, you got me singin' like
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back (oh no)
And we'll say, ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back, hey"
Shape of You,Ed Sheeran,"The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room

Photograph,Ed Sheeran,"Loving can hurt
Loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
Times forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer
'Til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home

Loving can heal
Loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know (know)
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
Times forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer
'Til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone

And if you hurt me
That's OK, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat
Where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul

And if you hurt me
Well, that's OK, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

When I'm away
I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost
Back on 6th street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
""Wait for me to come home""
"
Perfect,Ed Sheeran,"I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it,
Darling, you look perfect tonight

Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress
Looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this
Darling, you look perfect tonight

No, no, no

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight"
Merry Christmas,Ed Sheeran,"Build a fire and gather 'round the tree
Fill a glass and maybe come and sing with me
So kiss me under the mistletoe
Pour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snow
I know there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it go
Next year, you never know
But for now, Merry Christmas
We'll dance in the kitchen while embers glow
We've both known love, but this love we got is the best of all
I wish you could see it through my eyes then you would know
My God, you look beautiful right now
Merry Christmas
The fire is raging on
And we'll all sing along to the song
Just having so much fun
While we're here, can we all spare a thought
For the ones who have gone?
Merry Christmas, everyone
So just keep kissing me under the mistletoe
Pour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snow
I know there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it go
Next year, you never know
But for now, Merry Christmas
We'll dance in the kitchen while embers glow
We've both known love, but this love we got is the best of all
I wish you could see it through my eyes then you would know
My God, you look beautiful right now
Merry Christmas
I feel it when it comes
Every year, helping us carry on
Filled up with so much love
All the family and friends all together
Where we all belong
Merry Christmas, everyone
It's Christmas time for you and I
We'll have a good night and a merry Christmas
It's Christmas time for you and I
We'll have a good night and a merry Christmas
It's Christmas time for you and I
We'll have a good night and a merry Christmas
It's Christmas time for you and I
We'll have a good night and a merry Christmas time"
Castle on the Hill,Ed Sheeran,"When I was six years old, I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long
I know I've grown, but I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and
Getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night
I don't reckon that I did it right, but
I was younger then, take me back to when
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long
Oh, how we've grown, but I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill (hill)
Over the castle on the hill (hill)
Over the castle on the hill (hill)
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids, but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by, but
These people raised me
And I can't wait to go home
And I'm on my way
I still remember these old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill (hill)
Over the castle on the hill (hill)
Over the castle on the hill"
Bad Habits,Ed Sheeran,"One, two, three, four
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true
It's true, my bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights, and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true
It's true, my bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
We took the long way 'round
And burned 'til the fun ran out, now
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true
It's true, my bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you"
Celestial,Ed Sheeran,"You see, tonight, it could go either way
Hearts balanced on a razor blade
We are designed to love and break
And to rinse and repeat it all again
I get stuck when the world's too loud
And things don't look up when you're goin' down
I know your arms are reachin' out
From somewhere beyond the clouds
You make me feel
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away
You make me feel
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out into space
Celestial
Celestial
I see the light shinin' through the rain
A thousand colors in a brighter shade
Needed to rise from the lowest place
There's a silver lining that surrounds the grey
When I get lost, will you come back around?
Things don't look up when you're goin' down
I know your arms, they are reachin' out
From somewhere beyond the clouds
You make me feel
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away
You make me feel
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out into space
Celestial
Celestial, oh-oh
We were made to be
Nothin' more than this
Finding magic in all the smallest things
The way we notice, that's what really matters
Let's make tonight go on and on and on
You make me feel
(We were made to be nothing more than this)
(Finding magic in all the smallest things)
You make me feel
(The way we notice, that's what really matters)
(Let's make tonight go on and on and on)
You make me feel
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away
You make me feel
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out into space
Celestial, oh-oh
Celestial, oh-oh
Celestial
We were made to be
Nothing more than this (oh-oh)
Finding magic in all the smallest things (celestial)
The way we notice, that's what really matters (oh-oh)
Let's make tonight go on and on and on

Datang untuk Pergi,Elvy Sukaesih,"Sungguh hatimu bagai batu
Tak menaruh iba padaku
Yang menanggung rindu menantikanmu
Kau datang tanpa undanganku
Kau tanamkan cinta padaku
Dan setelah itu kau tinggalkanku
Mengapa engkau datang bila untuk pergi?
Kau buat aku senang lalu kau sakiti
Mengapa engkau datang bila untuk pergi?
Kau buat aku senang lalu kau sakiti
Sehingga kini hatiku merana
Sungguh hatimu bagai batu
Tak menaruh iba padaku
Yang menanggung rindu menantikanmu
Mengapa engkau datang bila untuk pergi?
Kau buat aku senang lalu kau sakiti
Mengapa engkau datang bila untuk pergi?
Kau buat aku senang lalu kau sakiti
Sehingga kini hatiku merana
Sungguh hatimu bagai batu"
Mockingbird,Eminem,"Yeah
I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me
Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears, daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Laney uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up, his daddy, daddy had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have gotten so bad between us, I don't see us ever being together
Ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control, over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up, and this will all just be a dream
Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper-lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise momma's gon' be alright
Huh, it's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said, ""Some of 'em were from me, 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em""
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause daddy felt like a bum
See daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broke into and robbed
Or shot up on the block
And your Mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you, so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot, so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one-bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his C.D
And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V
And momma didn't like it, and you and Laney were to young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscing, lookin' at your baby pictures
It just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown
It's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and daddy's still here
Laney, I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, It's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh, momma's only gone for the moment
Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper-lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, momma's gon' be alright
And if you ask me too
Daddy's gonna buy you a Mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that Mockingbird don't sing, and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdies neck
I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every karat, don't fuck with dad (haha)"
The Real Slim Shady,Eminem,"May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here?
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (ah!)
It's the return of the-, oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?
And Dr. Dre said-, nothing you idiots
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (haha)
Feminist women love Eminem
Chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who, yeah, but he's so cute though
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse, than what's goin' on in your parents bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips
And if I'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals
Well, some of us are cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes...
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up?
Please stand up, please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up?
Please stand up, please stand up
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy
Half of you critics can't even stomach me
Let alone stand me
But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?
Why, so you guys can just lie to get me here
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hehe!
I should download her audio on mp3
And show the whole world, how you gave Eminem VD (ahh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk talk and act like me
And just might be, the next best thing, but not quite me
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up?
Please stand up, please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up?
Please stand up, please stand up
I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugar-coat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder, how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?
It's funny 'cause at the rate I'm goin' when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurses asses while I'm jackin' off with Jergens
And I'm jerkin' but this whole bag of Viagra isn't workin'
In every single person there's a Slim Shady lurkin'
He could be workin' at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parkin' lot circling, screamin' I don't give a fuck
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady, please stand up?
And put one of those fingers, on each hand up
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time loud as you can, how does it go?
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up?
Please stand up, please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up?
Please stand up, please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up?
Please stand up, please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up?
Please stand up, please stand up
Haha, guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up"
Without Me,Eminem,"Obie Trice, real name no gimmicks
Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Guess who's back?
Back again
Shady's back
Tell a friend
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back?
I've created a monster
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
They want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty, without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this is about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you, Debbie!
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
Little hellions, kids feelin' rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch""
A visionary, vision of scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna tune it in and then I'm gonna
Enter in, endin' up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting, in your kid's ears and nesting
""Testing, attention, please""
Feel the tension, soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said, this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
A-tisket a-tasket, I go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talkin' this shit that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You 36-year-old bald headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listen to techno
Now let's go, just gimme the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
No, I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And used it to get myself wealthy (hey)
There's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty, without me
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
Kids!"
"Lose Yourself
",Eminem,"Look
If you had
One shot
Or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it
Or just let it slip?
Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
He's so stagnant, he knows, when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better
His soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows, it's all over, these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on
Da-da-dum, da-dum, da-da
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
Five and I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family 'cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer
This is my life and these times are so hard
And it's getting even harder tryna feed and water my seed, plus
Teeter totter, caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much
For me to wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, is my shot
Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better
You can do anything you set your mind to, man"
Till I Collapse,Eminem,"Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
And when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up
But you got to search within you, and try to find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you
And get that motivation to not give up, and not be a quitter
No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
'Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
'Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop penning 'em
And I am not Hip-Hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sending 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenalin shots, the penicillin could not get the illing to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal cop-killing hip hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're coming with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it
Like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzing up?
For shizzle my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck!
'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
Music is like magic, there's a certain feeling you get
When you real and you spit and people are feeling your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
Because I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walking 'round like nothing's bothering me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate, hit me
'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd, how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em
The track is on some battling raps who want some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so
'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
Until the roof (until the roof)
The roof comes off (the roof comes off)
Until my legs (until my legs)
Give out from underneath me
I, I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me"
Rap God,Eminem,"Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance (six minutes-, six minutes-)
Something's wrong, I can feel it (six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You are just what the doc ordered
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot
But for me to rap like a computer, it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""Bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run-D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay, I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!"" That's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""Way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""Hell, yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause-
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton-, no, Asgard, Asgard
So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a .9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24-7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything
You say is ricochetin' off of me, and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop, "" 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head, there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard, be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?"
Stan,Eminem,"My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window (window)
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window (window)
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you could've signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For four hours and you just said, ""No""
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else, so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up, you gotta call me, man
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S. we should be together too
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window (window)
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
Dear Mr. I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans
This will be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing ninety on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka
You dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who could have saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim, shut up bitch, I'm tryna talk
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates, she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window (window)
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was, it was you
Damn!"
Not Afraid,Eminem,"I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
Yeah
To take a stand (to take a stand)
It's been a ride
Everybody (everybody)
I guess I had to go to that place
Come take my hand (come take my hand)
To get to this one
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Now some of you might still be in that place
Whatever weather, cold or warm
If you're tryna get out (just lettin' you know that you're not alone)
Just follow me (holla if you feel like you've been down the same road)
I'll get you there
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'm a do somethin', I do it
I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No if, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From ""Infinite"" down to the last ""Relapse"" album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly, until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
You said you was king
You lied through your teeth, for that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans
I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last ""Relapse"" CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack, blaow, 'cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around but it's time to exercise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today
I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'ma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now (now)
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't realize what you did, ('cause) believe me you
I been through the wringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead
No more beef lingers, no more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it, 'cause the way I feel
I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub
And lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road"
Love the Way You Lie,Eminem,"Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off of love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her, the more I suffer
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown
She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me
And I love it, ""Wait
Where you going?"" ""I'm leaving you""
""No you ain't, come back""
We're running right back, here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful
I feel so ashamed, I snapped, ""Who's that dude?""
I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you, even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em
You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns
Same routine, but your temper's just as bad as mine is
You're the same as me, when it comes to love, you're just as blinded
Baby, please come back, it wasn't you
Baby, it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie"
Godzilla,Eminem,"I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walkin' around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby, ""The
Brain"" Heenan which is probably the same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia, ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisi' (hey, hey)
In AA, with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (ayy)
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughin' all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the (ayy)
Monster
You get in my way? I'ma feed you to the monster (yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night turn to a monster (yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
I'm just a product of Slick Rick, at Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled at so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with the missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of Vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a
Monster
You get in my way? I'ma feed you to the monster (yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night turn to a monster (yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
If you never gave a damn, raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point, like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (finger), prostate exam ('xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flier
I got 'em passin' out like what you do, when you hand someone flyers
What goes around, comes around just like the blades on a chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flaps of my dollar stack
Right off the bat like a baseball, like Kid Ink
Bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (cheesecake!)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretendin' to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her, if she'll bury her
Face on my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Christian Rivera
'Cause my lyrics never sit well, so they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Harry Carry
'Cause every Tom and Dick and Harry
Carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary
Got 'em swearin' up and down, they can't spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets Evil
That means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheets, what attracts these people
Is my gangster, bitch, like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack these chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom, and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em, I'm dumpin' their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliteratin' everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Atilla, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me, out of me
You don't want to be the enemy of the demon
Who went in me, and be on the receiving of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me is the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl
I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full
I'm not afraid to pull a-, man, stop
Look what I'm plannin' (haha)"
Beautiful,Eminem,"Lately, I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you callin me?
Are you tryin' to get through?
Are you reachin' out for me?
I'm reachin' out for you
I'm just so fuckin' depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
And I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm startin' to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and tried to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
I need a new outlet
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful (oh)
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful (oh-oh)
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (yeah, so)
I think I'm startin' to lose my sense of humor
Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature
Of the room, just as soon as
I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that, then it opens a door
For conversation like I want that
I'm not lookin' for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' manservant
Tryna follow me around, and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny like
""Ha, Marshall, you're so funny, man
You should be a comedian, goddamn""
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful (oh-oh)
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful (oh-oh)
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)
Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now I could have either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
Or sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in, in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant actin' stupid
Aunt Edna always told me
""Keep makin' that face, it'll get stuck like that""
Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there
Holding my tongue, tryin' to talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on the frozen stop sign pole at eight years old
I learned my lesson then
'Cause I wasn't tryin to impress my friends no more
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
Is probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's
Let's see if you can fit your feet
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful (oh-oh)
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful (oh-oh)
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)
Lately, I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own (oh-oh)
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone (so)
Are you callin' me?
Are you tryin' to get through? (oh-oh)
Are you reachin' out for me?
Then I'm reachin' out for you (so)
Yeah, to my babies, stay strong
Dad'll be home soon
And to the rest of the world
God gave you them shoes to fit you
So put 'em on and wear 'em
Be yourself, man
Be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny
Don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful (so)"
Lucky You,Eminem,"Whoa, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon
Fuck the system, I'm that people, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
Fuck you too, woah!
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice
Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you all and you finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told them the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My twelve days of Christmas was nothin' but lies
I, run at you hard like a sumo (sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (chulo)
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno
Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw four like a Uno
Cállate boca mejor maricón little puto, and all of you culo
They debated the level, I've been to ghetto to ghetto
Looking for something I prolly could never find now
Shit get real up until the beef die down
In truth a people just really want me tied down
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these people to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (yeah)
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
people wrong way, wrong road
Snakes in the grass, tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I been eatin' long enough, man my stomach should be full
I just ate, lick the plate, my buffet, lucky me
Fuck you think? (Woo!)
I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghostwriters
But to these kids, it don't actually matter
They're askin' me ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""
I said ""I don't have any answers""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually coming from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say ""What a wonderful feeling!""
We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me, the inability to pin humility
Hatata batata, why don't we make a bunch of fuckin'
Songs about nothin' and mumble!
And fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap, let's recap
Way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADATs, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP, and bring Masta Ace back
Because half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat that would take that
Feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me the snap though (lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention I'm probably makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' the dicks
In the fuckin' back, ho (get it?)
On the brink, any minute
Got me thinkin' of finishin' everything
With acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat, I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine
With the minithin, it better be at least 70 to 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain would pour
And that drought y'all have been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy
So y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, how 'bout I shoot?
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice"

Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?
Try acid and get fucked up worse that my life is?
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate
And Dr. Dre said
""Slim Shady you a base-head!""
Uh-uh!
""So why's your face red? Man you wasted!""
Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass, faster than a fat bitch
Who sat down too fast
Come here, slut!
""Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg!""

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in Junior High
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser
Chased him with a stapler
Stapled his nuts to a stack of papers
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a space ship
While they screamin' at me
""Let's just be friends!""
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
Try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
So I signed it
""Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole!""

Stop the tape!
This kid needs to be locked away!
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
Am I comin' or goin'?
I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka
Dare me to drive?
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breast feed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits!
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head
I'm steamin' mad
And by the way when you see my dad?
Tell him that I slit his throat, in this dream I had

No Love,Eminem,"Don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more
Don't hurt me no more
(Don't hurt me, don't hurt me)
(No more)
Young Money
Yeah (no more)
Uh (love)
Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's, ""Fuck the world"", get a child out her
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothin' 'bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers (love)
I'm rolling Sweets, I'm smokin' sour
Married to the game but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my night stands are full of open Bibles
Uh, I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expecting not to sweat
And these people know I lay 'em down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
Money outweighin' problems on a triple beam
I'm sticking to the script, you people skipping scenes
Uh, be good or be good at it
Fucking right, I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in their mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch, up, up and away, man, I'll come down in a couple of days
Okay, you want me up in a cage, then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code
It's Weezy motherfucker, Blood gang and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found
It's a little too late
To say that you're sorry now (yeah)
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just don't (hurt me)
That's right, it don't (hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna see you (no more)
Ha, bitch, you get no (love)
You showed me nothing but hate
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around (yeah)
And you don't (hurt me)
That's right, you don't (hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna see you
Ha, bitch, you get no love (no), no love (no)
No love (no), no love
Ha, bitch, you get no love (no), no love (no)
No love
And I don't need you (no more)
Get 'em
I'm alive again
More alive than I have been in my whole entire life
I can see these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
I'm a little bit sicker than most, shit's finna get thick again
They say the competition is stiff, but I get a hard dick from this shit
Now stick it in
I ain't never giving in again
Caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers, how I treat 'em
So why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em (yeah)
They call me a freak 'cause I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em
Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage, where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?
Snatch the mic from him, bitch I'ma let you finish in a minute
Yeah, that rap was tight, but I'm 'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might wanna go back to the lab tonight and, um (yeah)
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump in the place
All the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd (yeah)
You can see the sparks from hot metal (yeah)
Cold-hearted, from the day I Bogarted the game
My soul started to rot, fellow (yeah)
When I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted, 'cause Marsh is not mellow
'Til I'm topplin' from the top, I'm not gonna stop
I'm standin' on my Monopoly board (uh)
That means I'm on top of my game
And it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore (shit)
When you're so good that you can't say it
'Cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore (shit)
People just get sick 'cause you spit
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore (ow)
And you can never break my stride (no)
You'll never slow the momentum at any moment
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride
Killin' the flow, slow venom
Any opponent is gettin' no mercy, mark my words
Ain't lettin' up, relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck, keep givin' them hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
You get no love
It's a little too late
To say that you're sorry now (uh)
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just don't (hurt me)
Yeah, that's right, it don't (hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna see you (no more)
Ha, bitch, you get no (love)
You showed me nothing but hate (yeah)
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around (yeah)
And you don't (hurt me)
That's right, you don't (hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna see you (no more)
Ha, bitch, you get no love (no), no love (no)
No love (no), no love
Ha, bitch, you get no love (no), no love (no)
No love
And I don't need you (no more)
Ha, bitch, you get no (love)"
Shake that,Eminem,"Shady, Aftermath
There she goes shaking that ass on the floor
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losing control
Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunked, get fuucked up
Hit the strip club don't forget ones get your dick rubbed
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit faceted
Pasted, blasted, puke drink up, get a new drink
Hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine
Knowin' still got a few chunks on them shoestrings
Showin I was dehydrated till the beat vibrated
I was revibed as soon as this bitch gyrated
And hips and licked them lips and that was it
I had to get nate dogg here to sing some shit
Two to the one from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good trees
Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe
And I get more ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountain top
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo ass I'm gon' continue to rock
Getcha ass of the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fly girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie
We 'bout to have a party (turn the music up)
Let's get it started (go head shake your butt)
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it 'bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say everyday she be givin' it up
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Ohh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rinse
Swish but don't spit it, swallow and I'll finish
Yeah me and nate d-o double g
Looking for a couple bitches with some double d's
Pop a little champagne and a couple e's
Slip it in her bubbley, we finna finna have a party
Have a party (turn the music up)
Let's get it started (go head shake your butt)
I'm lookin' for a girl I can fuck in my hummer truck
Apple bottom jeans and a big ol butt
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it 'bout it
I want a bitch that sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can, but she won't say no
Now look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Tonight I want a slut, would you be mine?
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine
Now I'ma hope you don't get mad at me
But I told nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
I told him how you like it from behind
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Ohh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me

There she goes, shaking that ass on the floor
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole

I think I'm losing control
C'mon, I ain't leaving without you, bitch, c'mon with me
And my boy, and this boy, and this boy and his girl... nate dogg"
Discombobulated,Eminem,"Oh, ayo, Dre
I'm discombobulated
Let's take 'em back (accents)
In time (everything's all fucked up)
I'm discombobulated, discombobulated
Miss, you ovulating? Wait, I didn't mean to
Piss you off, my lady, what I really meant to say is
It goes a little something like this
Soon as I'm through with the Unisom I'ma hit the snooze alarm
Before I lose my mind, who am I gonna use it on?
Utilizing this tool, I will execute a line
Like what I tried to do one time in my youth when I euthanized
My poodle in junior high, used to hide in my room and fly
To the moon and try suicide with the glue from my school supplies
Then Proof, Denaun
Eye-Kyu and I would climb in that hooptie to ride to Drew's and rhyme
Bodied Saint Andrew's Hall too many times to count
Before I tear up The Shelter, give my dawgs a pound
Now I'm 'bout to treat all of you rappers noggins how
Dre does every time he goes back to Compton now
'Cause every so often I'll visit my old stomping grounds
And Doc's in the house, so you know the bong is out
Room is spinning like nine-hundred-thousand miles an hour
Forgot what I'm talkin' 'bout, fuck, I'm discombobulated
Now up is down, left is right
Day is night now, in is out, black is white
So to-and-fro and side-to-side
Am I coming or going? Man, I can't decide
'Cause back is forth now and stop means go
No means yes, but yes don't mean no
So, baby, please, take off your clothes
(No!) Yes! (No!) Yes! (No!) No! (Yes!) Oh! (Oh!), yeah
Just flew the coop, the cops are in hot pursuit
But the day they catch me is the day 50'll call a truce
And quash the feud with him and Ja and Ja'll actually spit a bar
That's not from a Dr. Seuss book and they'll start a group (haha)
Fuck it, I'm a kook, I know I got a screw
And a couple of marbles loose, brain is like ramen soup
Shout to Trugoy, gotta give a De La salute
'Cause my noodle's in a knot, call it pasta noose (yeah)
Wizard of ahs and oohs
Same Marshall Bruce in that battle who lost to Juice
Who also used to sound like Nas on ""Live at the Barbeque""
Now I got the juice, wouldn't beef if I was you
Like, au jus, but beef, if like
""I was you, "" but, like, ah, fuck you (man)
Long as I got these walls and these hallways I'm always
Have someone to argue with
I'm just all twisted, I'm discombobulated, man
Now up is down, left is right
Day is night now, in is out, black is white
So to-and-fro and side-to-side
Am I coming or going? Man, I can't decide
'Cause back is forth now and stop means go
No means yes, but yes don't mean no
So, baby, please, take off your clothes
(No!) Yes! (No!) Yes! (No!) No! (Yes!) Oh! (Oh!)
I'm at my best when I'm at my worst
And for that I'm blessed, so every time I rap I curse
And that's why press, I usually get attacked by first
They're at my neck like motherfucking vampires
So critics si-day I si-day the same shi-dit, I'm always degrading, little bi-ditch
Well, fi-duck 'em, they can si-duck my di-dick when I'm taking a shi-dit
Mid-y middle fid-inger is ex-tid-ended now, should I tell 'em where to put it?
I'm si-do fed up with it, they ask me dumb shi-dit
So I act like I'm on a kayak with my back to Niagara
No life jacket, man, I had like six psychiatrists, scientists
Misdiagnose me with plaque psoriasis 'cause I asked 'em, ""Why is it
My eye itches?"" so they gave me some diet tips
And Viagra with side effects, I might end up growing spiderwebs
In my head and dying a horrifying death, on my final breath
I will tell you, apply your lips to my dick, it's one size that fits
I just took an AIDS test and the doctor said to think positive, what the fuck?
Now up is down, left is right
Day is night now, in is out, black is white
So to-and-fro and side-to-side
Am I coming or going? Man, I can't decide
'Cause back is forth now and stop means go
No means yes, but yes don't mean no
So, baby, please, take off your clothes
(No!) Yes! (No!) Yes! (No!) No! (Yes!) Oh! (Oh!)
Haha, yeah

Uh-huh
I know what you wanna hear
'Cause I know you want me, baby
I think I want you too
(I think I love you, baby)
I think I love you too
I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together
Let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me, baby
You know I want you too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl
Come be in Shady's world
(Ooh boy, you drive me crazy)
Bitch, you make me hurl
They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now, got no ring on this finger now
I'll never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship, save it bitch
Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl, you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I'll tell a mo'fuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's her face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips, bitch why ask?
Kiss my dick, hit my cash
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out? I'll put you out
Won't get out? I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice?
Bitch, if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What you tryin' to be, my new wife?
What you Mariah? Fly through twice
But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass
On that fuckin' runway, hoe
'Cause I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman
Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret everybody knows
Yeah, we fucked, bitch, so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
You'll never know what kind of car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partying then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
I never loved you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you
But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day

Bitch, you make me hurl
First thing you said
I'm not fazed
I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyway
You're just plain ol' Marshall to me
Ooh yeah, girl, run that game
Hailie Jade? I love that name
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
Rot In Pieces?
Uh, that's great
First off you don't know Marshall
At all, so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave handprints all across you
Good Lordy-wody, you must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl, that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two backhands
Put Anthrax on a Tampax
And slap you 'til you can't stand
Girl, you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans
But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday

Rumah Singgah,Fabio Asher,"Saat hatimu terluka

Mengapa sulit
Untuk ku bisa miliki hatimu?
Bahkan s'lama ini
Hadirku tak berharga untukmu
Yang terjadi kini
Ku hanya rumah persinggahanmu di saat kau terluka
Dan di saat semuanya reda
Kau menghilang begitu saja
Jika memang ini tak ada harapan
Mengapa aku yang harus jadi tujuan?
Saat hatimu terluka, aku yang jadi obatnya

Bukan berarti ku tak merasa
Ada yang berbeda di antara kita
Dan tak mungkin ku melewatkanmu hanya karena
Diriku tak mampu untuk bicara
Bahwa aku inginkan kau ada di hidupku
Kini ku tak lagi dengannya
Sudah tak ada lagi rasa
Antara aku dengan dia
Pikirlah saja dulu
Hingga tiada ragu
Agar mulus jalanku
Melangkah menuju ke hatimu"
Hati Memilih Cinta,"Ilham Nahumarury
","Awalnya hidup terasa
Indah seperti kubayangkan
Sampai kau datang
Mengganggu rasa
Dulu tak ada yang salah

Sampai kau datang
Merusaknya
Aku benci kepada kamu
Tapi hati memilih cinta
Inginnya ku menjauh
Menghapus jejakmu
Tetapi hidup malah satukan
Aku dan kamu bahagia
Hu oh

Sedalam cintamu,Indra Lesmana,"Terasa kini
Pesonamu hadir debarkan hari
Telah kau datangkan hayal nyata janji
Kedalam sukmaku
Menuai rinduku
Harum tubuhmu
Buai lelapku
Sirnakan segala resahku
Sedalam dalam cintamu kuselami
Warna warna terindah yang ada di bumi
Terlukis di jiwa telah membelai kalbu
Sedalam cintamu tercipta untukku
Ketika hati
Tak kuasa pergi menyepi sendiri
Telah kau yakinkan setia yang teruji
Dibatas waktuku
Menggapai cintaku
Aura hatimu
Sentuh hatiku
Sinari ruang asaku
Telah kusadari
Cinta tak terbatas
Rona masa yang berganti
Ikuti hati

Pecinta Wanita,Irwansyah,"Ku temukan dalam pencarian
Cinta sejati untuk hidupku
Kurang lebih yang seperti dia
Ku harap dalam cintaku

Pelangi Di Matamu,Jamrud,"30 menit kita di sini
Tanpa suara
Dan aku resah harus menunggu lama
Kata darimu
Mungkin butuh kursus merangkai kata
Untuk bicara
Dan aku benci harus jujur padamu
Tentang semua ini
Jam dinding pun tertawa
Kar'na ku hanya diam dan membisu
Ingin kumaki diriku sendiri
Yang tak berkutik di depanmu
Ada yang lain di senyummu
Yang membuat lidahku gugup, tak bergerak
Ada pelangi di bola matamu
Dan memaksa diri 'tuk bilang,Aku sayang padamu
Aku sayang padamu
Mungkin Sabtu nanti kuungkap semua
Isi di hati
Dan aku benci harus jujur padamu
Tentang semua ini
Jam dinding pun tertawa
Kar'na ku hanya diam dan membisu
Ingin kumaki diriku sendiri
Yang tak berkutik di depanmu
Ada yang lain di senyummu
Yang membuat lidahku gugup, tak bergerak
Ada pelangi di bola matamu
Seakan memaksa dan terus memaksa
Ada pelangi
Ada yang lain di senyummu
Yang membuat lidahku gugup, tak bergerak
Ada pelangi di bola matamu
Dan memaksa diri 'tuk bilang, Aku sayang padamu
Aku sayang padamu"

Sedang Jatuh Cinta,Jaz,"Hadirmu membuat diriku kembali bahagia
Setelah sekian lama kumerasakan hampa
Sekejap duniaku menjadi berwarna
Kau rubah segalanya
Dalam hatiku bertanya
Hu
Sekejap duniaku menjadi berwarna
Kau rubah segalanya
Dalam hatiku bertanya
Mengapa dirimu tak bisa menghilang dari pikiranku
Mengapa hatiku selalu saja mengarah kepadamu
Dan memang hanya kamu lagi-lagi kamu
Terlintas di benakku
Mungkin memang aku sedang
Jatuh cinta
Diriku bertanya pada bintang-bintang (bertanya bintang-bintang)

Berdua Bersama,Jaz,"Indah, ceria
Masa-masa berdua bersamamu (saat itu)
Canda, tawa
Manis lugu dirimu saat itu (aku cinta kamu)
Tak ingin aku berpisah sebentar saja
Kurasakan dunia milik berdua
Aku selalu salah tingkah
Saat di dekatmu
Kamu tetap yang terindah
Jangan pernah berubah
Berdua meraih mimpi kita
Kadang ada
Masalah yang pernah kita hadapi (hidup ini)
Jangan ragu
Kau dan aku pasti bisa lewati (lewati)
Percayalah ku akan selalu bersamamu
Karena itu sebuah janjiku padamu
Aku selalu salah tingkah
Saat di dekatmu
Kamu tetap yang terindah

Aku Butuh Kamu,Jaz,"Malam berganti makna
Senja kian menghilang
Sabar s'lalu mengikat
Ku tahu memang cinta tak s'lalu berpihak
Jika kau pergi, siapa yang urus diriku?
Mengerti hatiku, tolong kembalilah
Selama ku masih bisa sebut namamu
Tuhan sudah tahu, aku butuh kamu
Bingung harus memilih
Kenangan takkan terhapus
Terpapah di kesendirian
Ku tahu memang cinta tak harus miliki
Jika kau pergi, siapa yang urus diriku?
Mengerti hatiku, tolong kembalilah
Selama ku masih bisa sebut namamu
Tuhan sudah tahu, aku butuh kamu
Sepertinya susah untuk bertahan
Kutaruh cintamu dalam hati, hu-wo-oh
Jika kau pergi, siapa yang urus diriku?
Mengerti hatiku, tolong kembalilah
Selama ku masih bisa sebut namamu
Tuhan sudah tahu, ku butuh kamu
Tuhan sudah tahu, oh, aku butuh kamu"
Penipu Cinta,Jaz,"Belum sempat ku lihat senyum mu
Belum sampai ku lepas rindu ku
Malah kamu pergi dengan dia
Dibelakang ku kau mainkan aku
Kau penipu cinta tak bisa ku percaya
Kau buat hatiku jadi sakit
Padahal sebentar ku perginya tak lama
Tapi kau malah selingkuh
Malah kamu pergi dengan dia
Dibelakang ku kau mainkan aku
Kau penipu cinta tak bisa ku percaya
Kau buat hatiku jadi sakit (hatiku sakit)
Padahal sebentar ku perginya tak lama
Tapi kau malah selingkuh
Tak sempat kita bertemu
Tak sempat melepas rindu
Teganya dirimu kepadaku
Kini kau dengan dia wowo
Kau penipu cinta tak bisa ku percaya
Kau buat hatiku jadi sakit
Padahal sebentar ku perginya tak lama
Tapi kau malah selingkuh
Kau main di belakangku

Jikalau Kau Cinta,Judika,"Jikalau kau cinta, benar-benar cinta
Jangan katakan kamu tidak cinta

Putus atau Terus,"Judika
","Aku sedang bertanya-tanya
Tentang perasaan kita
Benarkah kita saling mencinta
Atau hanya pernah saling cinta
Bukankah kamu juga merasa
Dingin mulai menjalari percakapan kita
Pertanyaan kamu sedang apa
Terkesan hanya sebuah formalitas saja
Coba tanyakan lagi pada hatimu
Apakah sebaiknya kita putus atau terus
Kita sedang mempertahankan hubungan
Atau hanya sekedar menunda perpisahan
Bukankah kamu juga merasa
Dingin mulai menjalari percakapan kita
Pertanyaan kamu sedang apa
Terkesan hanya sebuah formalitas saja
Coba tanyakan lagi pada hatimu
Apakah sebaiknya kita putus atau terus
Kita sedang mempertahankan hubungan
Atau hanya sekedar menunda perpisahan, wo-oo
Bila kamu tanya, aku maunya apa
Aku mau kita terus bersama
Coba tanyakan lagi pada hatimu
Kita sedang mempertahankan hubungan
Atau hanya sekedar, oh-wo-wo
Hanya sekedar menunda perpisahan

Lantas,Juicy Luicy,"Lima hari sudah kurindu

Sembunyi untuk bertemu
Baru kau sapa kutersipu
Kau puji lupa amarahku
Karena kau paling tahu
Cara lemahkan hatiku
Walau tak ada yang pasti
Yang kau beri hanya mimpi
Lantas mengapa ku masih menaruh hati
Padahal kutahu kau t'lah terikat janji
Keliru ataukah bukan tak tahu
Lupakanmu tapi aku tak mau
Oh wo
Baru kau sapa kutersipu (tersipu)

Lupakanmu tapi aku tak mau
Pantaskah aku menyimpan rasa cemburu
Padahal bukan aku yang memilikimu
Sanggup sampai kapankah ku tak tahu
Akankah akal sehat menyadarkanku
Oh wo
Uh
Lantas mengapa ku masih menaruh hati

At school on the playground

Love Yourself,Justin Bieber,"For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh, girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well, I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinkin' I still care, I don't, but
You still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on, but now I know
I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinkin' I still care, I don't, but
You still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on, but now I know
I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself (yeah)
And if you think (you think) that I'm (that I'm)
Still holdin' on to somethin' (holdin' on, no)
You should go and love yourself"
Lonely,Justin Bieber,"Everybody knows my name now
But somethin' 'bout it still feels strange
Like lookin' in a mirror, tryna steady yourself
And seein' somebody else
And everything is not the same now
It feels like all our lives have changed
Maybe when I'm older, it'll all calm down
But it's killin' me now
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just lonely
I'm so lonely
Lonely
Everybody knows my past now
Like my house was always made of glass
And maybe that's the price you pay
For the money and fame at an early age
And everybody saw me sick
And it felt like no one gave
They criticized the things I did as an idiot kid
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just lonely
I'm so lonely
Lonely
I'm so lonely
Lonely"
Hold On,Justin Bieber,"You know you can call me if you need someone
I'll pick up the pieces if you come undone
Painting stars up on your ceiling 'cause you
Wish that you could find some feeling, yeah, yeah
You know you can call me if you need someone
I need you to hold on
Heaven is a place not too far away
We all know I should be the one to say we all make mistakes (we all make mistakes)

As Long As You Love Me,Justin Bieber,"As long as you love me

We're under pressure
Seven billion people in the world tryna fit in
Keep it together
Smile on your face, even though your heart is frowning
But hey now, you know girl

Girl, you know I got you
Us, trust, a couple things I can't spell without U
Now we on top of the world
'Cause that's just how we do
Used to tell me sky's the limit, now the sky's our point of view
Man, we stepping out, like woah, oh God
Cameras point and shoot
Ask me, ""What's my best side""
I stand back and point at you, you, you
The one that I argue with
Feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side
It's green where you water it

As long as you love me"
Sorry,Justin Bieber,"You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice, I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm not just tryna get you back on me (Oh, no, no)
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body (Your body)
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh

Never Say Never,Justin Bieber,"Never say never
Yeah, yeah, never ever
Never ever, ever, ever, ever, ever
See I never thought that I
Could walk through fire
I never thought that I
Could take the burn
I never had the strength
To take it higher
Until I reached the point
Of no return
And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny
I will never say never
I will fight
I will fight 'til forever
To make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up, up, up
And never say never
Ne-never say never
Ne-never say never
Ne-never say never
Never say it
Never, Never say it
I never thought I
Could feel this power
I never thought that I
Could feel this free
I'm strong enough to climb
The highest tower
And I'm fast enough to run
Across the sea
And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
'Cause this is my destiny
I will never say never
I will fight
I will fight 'til forever
To make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up, up, up
And never say never
Here we go
Guess who
J Smith and JB
I gotcha lil' bro
I can handle him
Hold up, I
I can handle him
Now he's bigger than me
Taller than me
And he's older than me
And stronger than me
And his arm's a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me
I be tryna chill
They be trying to side with the thrill
No pun intended
Was raised by the power of Will
Like Luke with the Force
If push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the fourth
Ice water in blood (let's go)
I gotta be the best
And yes we're the fliest
Like David and Goliath
I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars
So the moon's where I land (I'm gone)
I will never say never
I will fight
I will fight 'til forever
To make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up, up, up
And never say never
I will never say never
I will fight 'til forever
To make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up
Pick it up, Pick it up, up, up
And never say never
Ne-never say never
Never say it
Ne-never say never
Never say it
Ne-never say never
Never say it
And never say never
Ne-never say never
Never say it
Ne-never say never
Never say it
Ne-never say never
And never say never"
Hit The Ground,Justin Bieber,"I close my eyes, I take it slow
Lay on down and let me rest my soul
I've been so high, I've been so low
I'm just try a find my way back home
Can't help but roam
My signal's gone
Guess this journey's left me on my own
I don't care why I'm alone, alone, alone
And if I could
Forget about the way you love me
Forget about the world, we're set in stone
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now
If only I could hit the ground
I never thought that I'd be broken
I never thought I'd be this far from home
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now
If only I could hit the ground
If only I could hit the ground
If only I could hit the ground
I close my eyes, I take it slow
Lay on down and let me rest my soul
I've been so high, I've been so low
I'm just tryna find my way back home
Can't help but roam
My signal's gone
Guess this journey's left me on my own
I don't care why I'm alone, alone, alone
And if I could
Forget about the way you love me
Forget about the world, we're set in stone
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now
If only I could hit the ground
I never thought that I'd be broken
I never thought I'd be this far from home
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now
If only I could hit the ground
If only I could hit the ground
If only I could hit the ground
Take it one day at a time
Reach for the stars now
Oh, just leave the past behind
It's a part of living
It's a part of living
If only I could hit the ground
If only I could
If only I could hit the ground
I could hit the ground, right now
If only I could hit the ground
If I could hit the ground
Then I'd be falling down
If only I could hit the ground
If I could hit the ground
Then I'd be touching down
If only I could hit the ground"
All in It,Justin Bieber,"Don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it, heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it, all in it, all in it
If you got a twenty for all of your tries
Twenty for all of the times, the times you got back up, woah
You'd be a billionaire in a year
That's what you gotta think 'till you're there, on the regular
If you got a diamond for all of your passion, diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like cake and icy for every occasion, gotta go hard, yeah
Still don't condone it, love is a component
You're the only opponent, gotta seize the moment
Don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it, heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it, all in it, all in it
Gonna give each time
Said it won't hurt my side
Oh, don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it, all in it, all in it
All in it, all in it
Ever had a guitar missing five strings?
A guitar with only one string, I can only play one song, ooh
A simple melody, simple enough to make the world sing
Strong enough to make your mood swing, you know what I mean
If you got a diamond for all of your passion, diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like cake and icy for every occasion, gotta go hard, yeah
Still don't condone it, love is a component
You're the only opponent, gotta seize the moment
Don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it, heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it, all in it, all in it
Gonna give each time
Said it won't hurt my side
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it, all in it, all in it
All in it, all in it
See, growing up I
I always felt like I had to be the best at everything
'Cause I, I just didn't think I wasn't good enough
And maybe if I was good at something, that, that I'd get recognition from that but
I quickly found out that
I wasn't going to get the recognition that I wanted or that I needed because
Because, because people aren't perfect and
By not being perfect you, you sometimes can disappoint people
And with God, it's like He's perfect and He never disappoints
So I, I just get my recognition from Him
And give Him recognition"
We Are,Justin Bieber,"Happy birthday
You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth don't make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are
If it ain't broke then we don't need to fix it
Believing in what she say'll have you livid
Know they won't be happy 'til our love is over
They tryna break us up but you don't wanna get it
They ain't never had your back like how I got it
They ain't never had a chance how we got it
So they can't help but to come and hate on it
They see what we got and you know they want it

The raining of equations for you to solve 'em
So quick to turn nothin' right into somethin'
Get the numbers out my phone, go 'head and call 'em

Lose what we are (yeah)
She texts me ""How's you love life?""
And ""How are you?"", I said ""I'm good""
They only get as close as you allow them to
We should be closer together, warm oceans, better weather
Instead of us playing games forever, she says whatever
I says whatever, who get you wetter than a half moon wearer
History sweater, serendipity when you with me
Swear you love that one thing we did that one time in that one place
Blew your mind, you got my mind going when I'm home
I'm serious girl, a much older dude, a whole forty-two
I've accomplished my goals, it's only you
You and I in that wraith, retire my pimp super-fly cape
Just my Mets cap and my badge and I'm straight, Esco
Don't question it
You ain't gotta question it (oh)
You already know the answer (you already know the answer)
The truth don't make us relevant (the truth don't make us relevant)

No Sense,Justin Bieber,"Yeah, yeah
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you
The sun don't set the same as you're watching it go down with me
And I won't sleep the same unless you're waking up in here with me
Oh, my heart's a vacant house when you're gone away, it's so empty
And love don't make no sense when it's empty (Oh no)
I've driven almost every car
It ain't the same when I'm without you, boo
Been around a million stars
None of 'em shine brighter than you
The sky be so dark now without you
Yeah, ooh, baby
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you
Oh been around the world ain't the same without you
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you
Focus ain't the same if the picture ain't got you in it
In every limelight
Emotions ain't the same if it ain't about you, I don't get it
Ever since the beginning now
You had that effect on me
All I wanna do is you, oh
I mean that so literally
Don't nobody go harder than you
All of the angels must be lonely now, without you, woah
It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you
Cause I'm doing it with you baby
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you
I only want to hear your voice, yeah
Oh, been around the world, ain't the same without you

It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you
(Way up, way up, way up)
(Yeah, slow down stay up, stay up, stay up)
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you
Time and time again I break a plan
Without you girl I ain't the man
Could never be all I could be
You overstand, I'm incomplete
Apparently, you gotta know I hate that
How am I supposed to take that?
Boo'd up, missing all of that
Gotta be laying in that
Rolled up, put a flame to that
Couple times you would made it back, be patient
Won't you pull up to me now, I'm forever young
It's amazing
I don't want to sleep unless you at home
It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you
No, It don't make sense

Someone to share my reign
Tell me what you wanna drink

"I’ll Show You
",Justin Bieber,"My life is a movie
And everyone's watching.
So let's get to the good part
And pass all the nonsense
Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
But they don't even know that I'm hurting
This life's not easy
I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human
Don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me
But you never will
But that's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I gotta learn things
Learn them the hard way
Gotta see what it feels like
No matter what they say
Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
But they don't even know that I'm hurting
This life's not easy
I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human
Don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me
But you never will
But that's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
This life's not easy
I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human
Don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me
But you never will
But that's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show you
I'll show you"
Cerita Cinta,Kahitna,"Berawal dari mata indahnya senyuman
Mengapa harus resah
Berawal tatap mata hangatnya sapamu
Mengapa jadi gundah
Tak kusangka kita sama
Telah menyimpan getar cinta cinta
Biar cinta gelora di dada
Biar cinta memadukan kita
Cerita cinta yang pertama kurasa
Jangan pernah akhir cerita cinta kita
Kini rindu yang kupunya hanya untukmu
Hanya padamu
Apabila kita memang mesti bersatu
Mengapa harus ragu"
Cantik,Kahitna,"Cantik
Ingin rasa hati berbisik
Untuk melepas keresahan
Dirimu xantik
Bukan kuingin mengganggumu
Tapi apa arti merindu
Selalu
Walau mentari terbit di utara
Hatiku hanya untukmu
Ada hati yang termanis dan penuh cinta
Tentu saja kan kubalas seisi jiwa
Tiada lagi
Tiada lagi yang ganggu kita
Ini kesungguhan
Sungguh aku sayang kamu
Ingin ku berjalan menyusuri cinta
Cinta yang abadi untukmu selamanya"
Menikahimu,Kahitna,"Menantimu hingga saat
Cintaku temukan dirimu
Usai sudah sampai di sini
Berdiri melabuhkan asmara
Menikah denganku

Melintasi perjalanan usia

Andai Dia Tahu,Kahitna,"Bilakah dia tahu
Apa yang tlah terjadi
Semenjak hari itu
Hati ini miliknya
Mungkinkah dia jatuh hati
Seperti apa yang kurasa
Mungkinkah dia jatuh cinta
Seperti apa yang ku damba
Bilakah dia mengerti
Apa yang tlah terjadi
Hasratku tak tertahan
Tuk dapatkan dirinya
Mungkinkah dia jatuh hati
Seperti apa yang kurasa
Mungkinkah dia jatuh cinta

Tuk jatuh cinta
Hanya untukku

"Aku, Dirimu, Dirinya",Kahitna,"Tak ada yang harus kita sesali
Semua indah yang pernah kita alami
Meskipun terbatas dan tak mungkin terikat janji abadi
Aku, dirimu, dirinya
Tak akan pernah mengerti tentang suratan
Aku, dirimu, dirinya
Tak resah bila sadari
Cinta takkan salah
Andai waktu bisa kita putar kembali
Jalinan cerita mungkin tak begini
Aku, dirimu, dirinya
Tak akan pernah mengerti tentang suratan
Aku, dirimu, dirinya

Cinta takkan salah
Meskipun (meskipun)
Terbatas (terbatas) saling pandang

Kau Ubah Hariku,Kahitna,"Ku bertanya adakah aku yang ada di hatimu
Tak mengapa jikalau aku tak pasti di benakmu
Aku tak tahu mengapa dirimu
Yang datang saat aku merasa
Meskipun aku tak mungkin miliki
Namun ku akui kau ubah hariku
Ada getar saat ku menatapmu ada di sana
Ku yakini mata hatiku tak akan pernah salah
Aku tak tahu mengapa dirimu
Yang datang saat aku merasa
Meskipun aku tak mungkin miliki
Namun ku akui kau ubah hariku
Aku bertanya dan tanya kepada diri
Salahkah hatiku yang mengharapkan cintamu
Aku tak tahu mengapa dirimu
Yang datang saat aku merasa
Meskipun aku tak mungkin miliki
Namun ku akui kau ubah hariku
Namun ku akui kau ubah hariku

Merasa Tak Dicinta,Kahitna,"Tanyakan pada dia
Bahwa ku memang cinta
Usah kau bilang suka
Jika tak juga cinta
Bukan ku tak percaya
Bahwa kau juga cinta
Bukan ku tak mengerti
Jika tak ada cinta
Mengapa kau harus merasa tak dicinta
Membalas berdiam dan memendam perasaan cinta
Mengapa kau harus merasa tak dicinta
Bukankah kau yang ragu
Memilih tuk tak percaya padaku

Mengapa Terlambat,Kahitna,"Kau datang mengapa terlambat
Saat aku baru jadi dengannya
Aku resah harus ku perbuat apa
Semua datang tanpa pernah kuduga
Tergetarku di pandangan pertama
Sesaat pertemuan yang indah itu
Jangan pergi ku tak ingin
Semua ini berakhir
Hanya karena keadaanku
Dan kau berikan satu pertanda
Engkau juga telah menyimpan cinta
Aku resah harus ku perbuat apa
Ingin hati hindari kisah ini
Dan mencoba melupakan dirimu
Namun nyatanya ku tak bisa terima
Jangan pergi ku tak ingin
Semua ini berakhir
Hanya karena keadaanku
Bilakah mungkin kau kan menunggu
Sampai batas waktu yang tak kau tahu (ow oh)
Jangan pergi ku tak ingin
Semua ini berakhir
Hanya karena keadaanku
Jangan jauh ku tak rela
Semua indah berlalu
Terlalu cepat dari sisiku
Jangan pergi (oh) ku tak ingin (ku tak ingin)
Semua ini berakhir
Hanya karena keadaanku
Berlalu terlalu cepat dari sisiku
Berakhir hanya karena keadaanku
Kau datang mengapa terlambat"
Selamat Ulang Tahun Cinta,Kahitna,"Ingin saja ku berikan
Segala yang kau impikan
Mimpi yang sering kau katakan
Namun ku punya batasan
Kau teristimewa
Kaulah penyeri dunia
Dan kaulah segalanya bagiku
Ku tak punya wang berjuta
Apatah lagi istana
Untuk jadikan hadiah
Agar kau rasa berharga
Ini saja yang ku mampu
Sebuah lagu khas untukmu
Ku harap engkau kan suka
Selamat ulang tahun cinta
Tak tergambar dengan kata
Rasa tentang dalam jiwa
Satu purnama ku tak lena
Fikir lirik paling indah
Kau teristimewa
Kaulah penyeri dunia
Engkaulah segalanya bagiku
Ku tak punya wang berjuta
Apatah lagi istana
Untuk jadikan hadiah
Agar kau rasa berharga
Ini saja yang ku mampu
Sebuah lagu khas untukmu
Ku harap engkau kan suka
Selamat ulang tahun cinta
Muga kau selalu tertawa
Ceria disamping keluarga
Bahagia yang engkau rasa
Kekal sampai bila-bila
Ini saja yang ku mampu
Sebuah lagu khas untukmu
Ku harap engkau kan suka
Selamat ulang tahun cinta
Selamat ulang tahun cinta"
Cemburu Buta,Kahitna,"Sungguh ku tak mengerti jalan pikirannya
Cemburu buta bila kudekat denganmu
Aku mengenalmu pun sudah sejak lama
Ia mengenalmu tak lebih dari setahun
Dia se'lalu memandangi
Dia s'lalu membuang muka
Dia s'lalu gerah bila di dekatku
Namun engkau sahabatku, tak mau kehilanganmu
Hanya karena pacar barumu cemburu
Dia tak mengenalmu sepertiku mengenalmu
Jadi jangan coba-coba
Kar'na engkau sahabatku, tak mau kehilanganmu
Hanya karena pacar barumu cemburu
Dia tak mengenalmu sepertiku mengenalmu
Jadi jangan coba-coba
Kau memang miliknya
Mungkin bukan untuk selamanya

Pacarku,Kahitna,"Sekian kali engkau bertanya
Sekian lama aku mendengar
Tiap kali kau tanya lagi
S'lalu tanya tentang cintaku
Harus apa, harus kata apa lagi
Kata untuk yakinkan semua, ow, ow
Pacarku mengapa selalu, selalu tanya dan ragu-ragu padaku
Bukannya kau tahu, kau tahu diriku sungguh-sungguh padamu
Mengapa selalu, selalu tanya dan ragu-ragu padaku

Menanti,Kahitna,"Kemarin ku nanti
Kehadiran dirimu
Kedatangan cintaku
Mengapa (oh mengapa)
Tak kunjung tiba (tak kunjung tiba)
Dan ku dengar cerita
Kau berdua dengannya
Dimanakah janji indah itu
Yang dulu kau ungkap
Takkan terbagi yang lain
Bila memang kau ingkari
Takkan ku menanti oh oh
Haruskah kau ulangi
Haruskah aku mengerti
Bila pelangi cinta
Berselimutkan dusta oh
Dimanakah janji indah itu
Yang dulu kau ungkap
Takkan terbagi yang lain
Bila memang kau ingkari
Takkan ku menanti
Haruskah ku sesali
Tiada arti lagi
Terkadang ku sesali
Tak ada arti lagi
Indahnya meniti mimpi oh
Dimanakah janji indah itu
Yang dulu kau ungkap
Takkan terbagi yang lain
Dimanakah janji indah itu oh
Yang dulu kau ungkap
Takkan terbagi yang lain
Bila memang kau ingkari

Mantan Terindah,Kahitna,"Mengapa engkau waktu itu putuskan cintaku?
Dan saat ini engkau selalu ingin bertemu
Dan mengulang jalin cinta
Mau dikatakan apa lagi?
Kita tak akan pernah satu
Engkau di sana, aku di sini
Meski hatiku memilihmu
Andai 'ku bisa, ingin aku memelukmu lagi
Oh, di hati ini hanya engkau mantan terindah
Yang selalu 'ku rindukan
Mau dikatakan apa lagi?
Kita tak akan pernah satu
Engkau di sana, aku di sini
Meski hatiku memilihmu
Engkau meminta padaku
Untuk mengatakan bila 'ku berubah
Jangan pernah kau ragukan
Engkau 'kan selalu di langkahku, oh
Mau dikatakan apa lagi?
Kita tak akan pernah satu
Engkau di sana, aku di sini
Meski hatiku memilihmu
Engkau di sana, aku di sini
Meski hatiku memilihmu
Yang telah kau buat sungguhlah indah
Buat diriku susah lupa
"
Hampir Jadi,Kahitna,"Apa ini jelaskan padaku
Ku pikir hampir jadi
Masih saja salah langkahku
Meski impianku hancur di depan mata
Masih saja ku tunggu jawabmu
Ku bertahan
Haruskah ku akhiri
Aku tak tahu apakah nyata
Atau kah prasangka
Tak mungkin ku hindari
Sanggupkah aku terus melangkah
Atau ku pergi saja
Sampai hati statusku tak jelas
Kini impianku hancur di depan mata
Masih saja ku tunggu jawabmu
Ku bertahan
Haruskah ku akhiri
Aku tak tahu apakah nyata
Atau kah prasangka
Tak mungkin ku hindari
Sanggupkah aku terus melangkah
Atau ku pergi saja
Mau atau tak mau
Suka atau tak suka
Kan ku cari jalan sendiri
Jalan sendiri
Haruskah ku akhiri
Aku tak tahu apakah nyata
Atau kah prasangka
Tak mungkin ku hindari
Sanggupkah aku terus melangkah
Atau ku pergi saja
Haruskah ku akhiri
Aku tak tahu apakah nyata
Atau kah prasangka
Tak mungkin ku hindari
Sanggupkah aku terus melangkah
Atau ku pergi saja
Atau ku pergi saja"
Untukku,Kahitna,"Di saat engkau di sana
Kadang langit terasa gelapnya
Kemana langkahku pergi
S'lalu ada bayangmu
Kuyakin makna nurani
Kau takkan pernah terganti
Saat lautan kau seberangi
Janganlah ragu bersauh
Kupercaya hati kecilku
Kau takkan berpaling
Walau ke ujung dunia, pasti akan kunanti
Meski ke tujuh samudra, pasti ku 'kan menunggu
Karena kuyakin, kau hanya untukku
Saat lautan kau seberangi
Janganlah ragu bersauh
Kuyakin makna nurani
Kau takkan pernah terganti
Pandanglah bintang berpijar
Kau tak pernah tersembunyi
Dimana engkau berada
Di sana cintaku
Walau ke ujung dunia, pasti akan kunanti
Meski ke tujuh samudra, pasti ku 'kan menunggu
Karena kuyakin, kau hanya untukku
Karena kuyakin, kau hanya untuk, hanya untukku
Di saat engkau di sana
Kadang langit terasa gelapnya
Namun bintang 'kan tunjukan
Rinduku pada dirinya
Walau ke ujung dunia, pasti akan kunanti
Meski ke tujuh samudra, pasti ku 'kan menunggu
Walau ke ujung dunia, pasti akan kunanti
Meski ke tujuh samudra, pasti ku 'kan menunggu
Walau ke ujung dunia, pasti akan kunanti
Meski ke tujuh samudra, pasti ku 'kan menunggu
Karena kuyakin, kau hanya untukku
Karena kuyakin, kau hanya untukku
Hanya untukku
Hanya untukku (hanya untukku)

Insomnia,Kahitna,"Tak tidur semalam
Hatiku sakit
Bagai bulan temaram
Tertunduk sunyi
Kau ada di sana
Di pelukannya
Dan kau genggam tangannya
Ingin ku tak melihatnya
Yang kau lihat senyumku
Tak kau sadari pedihku
Namun hancurnya hatiku
Kau tak perlu tahu
Ku harap engkau bahagia
Walau hatiku terluka
Akan ku simpan cerita
Kau tak perlu tahu
Hanya aku yang harus tahu
Hanya aku yang harus menghadapi semua
Menyimpan rasa kecewa
Yang kau lihat senyumku
Tak kau sadari pedihku
Namun hancurnya hatiku
Kau tak perlu tahu
Ku harap engkau bahagia
Walau hatiku terluka
Akan ku simpan cerita
Kau tak perlu tahu
Hanya aku yang harus
Hanya aku yang harus
Hanya aku yang harus tahu"
"Salah Sendiri

",Kahitna,"Tanyakan pada dia
Bahwa ku memang cinta
Usah kau bilang suka
Jika tak bilang cinta
Bukan ku tak percaya
Bahwa kau juga cinta
Bukan ku tak mengerti
Jika tak ada cinta
Mengapa kau harus merasa takdir cinta
Membalas pedih yang dalam
Memendam perasaan cinta
Mengapa kau harus merasa takdir cinta

Memilih tuk tak percaya padaku

Bahwa ku memang cinta
Usah kau bilang suka
Jika tak juga cinta

Lebih Dari Sekedar Cantik,Kahitna,"Matamu yang indah bagai bulan sabit

Seluruh Nafas Ini,Last Child,"Lihatlah luka ini yang sakitnya abadi
Yang terbalut hangatnya bekas pelukmu
Aku tak akan lupa
Tak akan pernah bisa
Tentang apa yang harus memisahkan kita
Di saat ku tertatih
Tanpa kau disini
Kau tetap ku nanti
Demi keyakinan ini
Jika memang dirimulah tulang rusukku
Kau akan kembali
Pada tubuh ini
Ku akan tua dan mati
Dalam pelukmu
Untukmu seluruh nafas ini
Kita telah lewati
Rasa yang pernah mati
Bukan hal baru
Bila kau tinggalkan aku
Tanpa kita mencari
Jalan untuk kembali
Takdir cinta yang menuntunmu kembali padaku
Di saat ku tertatih (saat ku tertatih)
Tanpa kau disini (tanpa kau di sini)
Kau tetap ku nanti
Demi keyakinan ini
Jika memang kau terlahir
Hanya untukku
Bawalah hatiku dan lekas kembali
Ku nikmati rindu yang datang membunuhku
Untukmu seluruh nafas ini
Dan ini yang terakhir (aku menyakitimu)
Ini yang terakhir (aku meninggalkanmu)
Tak kan ku siasiakan hidupmu lagi
Ini yang terakhir
Dan ini yang terakhir
Tak kan ku sia siakan hidupmu lagi
Jika memang dirimulah tulang rusukku
Kau akan kembali
Pada tubuh ini
Ku akan tua dan mati
Dalam pelukmu
Untukmu seluruh nafas ini
Jika memang kau terlahir
Hanya untukku
Bawalah hatiku dan lekas kembali
Ku nikmati rindu yang datang
Membunuhku
Untukmu seluruh nafas ini
Untukmu seluruh nafas ini
Untukmu seluruh nafas ini"
Ruang rindu,Letto,"Di daun yang ikut mengalir lembut
Terbawa sungai ke ujung mata
Dan aku mulai takut terbawa cinta
Menghirup rindu yang sesakkan dada
Jalanku hampa dan kusentuh dia
Terasa hangat, oh, di dalam hati
Kupegang erat dan kuhalangi waktu
Tak urung jua kulihatnya pergi
Tak pernah kuragu dan s'lalu kuingat
Kerlingan matamu dan sentuhan hangat
Ku saat itu takut mencari makna
Tumbuhkan rasa yang sesakkan dada
Kau datang dan pergi, oh, begitu saja
Semua kut'rima apa adanya
Mata terpejam dan hati menggumam
Di ruang rindu kita bertemu
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Kau datang dan pergi, oh, begitu saja
Semua kut'rima apa adanya
Mata terpejam dan hati menggumam
Di ruang rindu kita bertemu
Bertemu
Hu-uh-uh"
Mural,Lupe Fiasco,"We're all chemicals, vitamins and minerals
Vicodin with inner tubes, wrapped around the arm
To see the vein like a chicken on the barn
Top cat chat, let's begin another yarn
That's flying saucer cheese, or is it chicken parm'
But roosters don't fly like boosters don't buy
So what powers cowards to get them to the top
Just to fall asleep listening to bach?
The ribbon in the sky is the ribbon that I drop
Dribbling the eye across the prism of a clock
That lacks meaning, but racks up stacks of fat reading
They catch chief and wrapped up plants from trap dealings
Now what's a coffin with a scratched ceiling?
And what's the talking without the match feeling?
As buried living and cherry picking
Every linen from your berry system
Then proceed with the pack feeding
When I was young I had visions of another world
Sneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother hurl
Incense smoke made vortices and other curls
Casting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls
I like my pancakes cut in swirls
Morrocan moles and undercover squirrels
I like cartoons, southern cities with large moons
Faith healers, ex-female drug dealers and art booms
Apologize for my weird mix
What taste like hot dogs and tear drips
And looks like pantomime and clear bricks
And smells like shotguns and deer piss
They on their hunt, kinda salty that I'm going hard
First part of a party, that I throw in parts
One minute you playing pool, next minute you throwing darts
But that's how you do with a party that you throw in bars
I run the gambit like I'm throwing cards
From popular mechanics to overdosing hearts
Paint cold pictures like nova scotia landscapes
Nerd game make mandelbrot sets when we handshake
A word game back up plan that can dam lakes
Backup the word play playin' at the man's states
Mean I can still be the man if the dam breaks
And when the man brakes I'm reflectious, what they can't face
My peers will still treat the mirror like it's a fan base
The unfettered veteran, the eagle feathered man of medicine
That hovers above cities like weather men
And maybe weather woman
Whatever better to tell ya weather comin'
I prefer girls to reign all over the world
And not rain like, rain man or rain like rain dance
Or rain like a slight chance of rain when it's raining
Or rein like deer slaves to santa claus sleigh man
But reign like queens that reign over made man
And not queen like queen killer, rhapsody bohemian queen
But queen like white glove wave hand
And not wave hand like it's a heat wave
So you make a fan by waving your hand
I'm talking wave like you saying ""hey""
Man, and not hay for horses and hoarse like you almost voiceless
You gotta treat your vocal chords like it's a fortress
And treat every single one of your words like reinforcements
And especially when you're recording
Cause that's the portion that's important
When I was reporting that I was poor
But now I'm more than
It's still hooker heels on my sugar hills and sweet spots
Crying shames, make margarita rims from cheap tops
Deep plots in floor, the ceiling windows for my peep pots
A little scene with the sickle swings to make the wheat drop
And a hundred words for them hummingbirds that like to eavesdrop
And fan out like peacocks with a parakeet that beat box
So the sun rise when the beat drops
And the sun dies when the beat stops
Then it unties, then it relocks
Then it relapsed, then it detox
Then heat back like a heat pack
On his knee caps of the weak spot
Cause he want what we got, like yeah
Then forge poetry like a young honory morrissey
Then spit it to the golden locks thots
Who like their porridge all watery
Not scorching nor sorbity
From the steel orbitings, sorcerer, sorcery
Coming down gorgeously, just like a stacey dash waterfall
A more torturing, a water boarding barbie doll
A river of women like a brazilian carnival
Swimming in feminine bikinis made out of barbasol
Somebody give them the volleyballs
If you love her, don't ever send her to mally mall's
Homie if she lonely she might end up in macauly's claws
Coming out the closet over goblets down at madri gras
The fame, champagne, walk of shame lobby call
My reposition was black condition of activism
Ammunition for abolition, missions attacking systems
But they not after listens, unless it's dropping on activision
Are we apps or are we bodies filled with apparitions
Operating applications, stuck inside a apple prison
Chicken hack and download updates that lack religion
Or are we more, than soil tainting, disloyal changelings
Preoccupied with boy and goyle chasing
And foiling other's royal saintings?
I sit back and watch the world through the eye holes in my oil paintings
Uh!
Ain't nothin' to it but to do it
Unless you virgin mary, nothin' do it but the truest
Believe all that unless you jewish
Life is not a dictionary, it's a thesaurus
And I feel like a missionary to a clitoris
The water bearer heir of traditions that I swear to never change
My chair position or conditions of my porridge
Submission for sedition against the religion of a chorus
Keep them golden weave thieves out the motherfuckin' forest
As I perform a nerve storm
I prefer my pictures in word form
Bury the hatchet like how a bird born
As I paint cold pictures like kool-aid facing condensation
Having conversations with flavorful combinations
Slave to my concentration
So that's oj the juiceman meets oj with two hands
And two gloves, that's too snug
To judge who was, who drew blood
And, lupe look at all these toucans
In a cemetery full of tomahawkes
Giving middle fingers to the pigeons doing somersaults
Road runners don't fall off cliffs, they run across
Anomalies by the colonies flukes by the reservoir
Wildin' pursuers end up as poofs on the desert floor
Levitating youth so know the truth of where the fountain hides
Bucaraa roof painting tunnels onto the mountain sides
A thousands parts a pound of heart an ounce of eyes
Announcing now the doubt in mouth pronounces a count of lies
Chocula counts by the counts of 5, refrigerator roof full of animals and monsters
Incinerated shoes and the manual for contra
Assorted memories from my childhood
Absorbing energy from the wild woods
Electronic combat konami sign contract
Chinese char killing cucarachas on contact
Chicago spread an aficionado
Efficient spitting bridging divisions is in chicano
Who's the boss? if isn't alyssa milano
Dudikoff, ninja mission into the congo
Polarize envy of the older guys
Black obi, shinobi hittin' kenno in the face with all my throwin' knives
Sub-zero guiding, hiding, riding in the pack as well
Sound village, leaf village, wolf spirit, magic spells
Dodging rain and catching hail
Faces need samurais to catch the l
Special research vessels made for catching whales
Fillet-a-fish ships sea-shepherded peppered with extra sails
Rewrite history, liberty needs a better bell
Maybe hotter irons and carbon fibres that never fail
Smarter science mixed with a odd alliance of fairytale
Or maybe just a metal pail that you hit with a steel tools
To announce that you've had enough and dropping out of seal school
Just like trout jumping out they house to let they gills cool
Cuba-scuba couldn't take the temperature of my skill pool
I said it feels cool to kill fools
Slipping through the cracks like when you trying to grill gruel
Take no viking water bottle and not following pill rules
Will have you off of the throttle when you should be modelin' chill mood
Roller skater maker or are you just cobblin' wheel shoes
Overweight taster of kings food that kills crews
Oblivious feather-weight baker who autographed cakes
Whenever his quill moves over your meal you
Simple as a buddhist monk in a temple
Standing in some heel groove with the abbot, practising stillness
Real still til he realizes his realness
Defeat samsara achieves nirvana and brilliance, yea"
Mural Jr,Lupe Fiasco,"Holy assumption of man into the heaven's sphere
Many mansions fit champions within its seven tiers
Evangelists re-imagine every 11 years
Pause for applause, evolves to what was never here
Born to death, born to die
Form the flesh, form the eyes
A veritable storm of winged forms swarms the skies
Marital norms unperformed but the porn survives
In the dorms of the scorn, they keep warm supplies
Gone to lose the use of tooth, horn and thigh
Farthest standing, I was landing
Two one hand, one man bands jamming in tandem
He who power naps, then plans gathering ransoms
And maps man's laps in a hand lathered in absinthe
Gotta talent traffic and ramblings
And handing out amazing handmade maps of the labyrinth
Out the back of the wagon
Out the back of the madam
Out the back of the Magnum
Then out the trap of enchantment
Bellerophon with a megaphone, megaman
Desert zone run marathons with sweaters on (sweaters on)
That was so simple but hot, in a place where it's so simple but not
Closed temples and ole little forgots and rode whole chissles
Cripples with raw missles a lot
The old hoes that they won't give you a shot
But you can get the whole pistol, it's gon' hit you a lot
These are real words from a savage mind
Unmaximized man on an average climb
Who don't deserve the whole truth and only half your time
Fit the life of a whole booth in only half a line
In the future life, I don't even have to rhyme
We'll get the entire Armageddon with only half the signs
Just yields and rail roads
In lush fields with bell tolls
Couple huddles of the unskilled but well told
It's unreal how off one deal to sell souls
And he got em' by the dozen
Medulla oblongata is what got them by the oven
Like how the moonshine is what got him by the cousin
He gotta buy the bottom and he 'bout to stick his tongue in
Such an unsettling scene
An obscene setting for the unwedding of rings
The sharpest dresser at the unheading of queens
The architecture is something you've never seen
Dream clean
That's three words at the same time
They killed three bird with the same
And one each in every hand with the same bluffing
Answers each and every man with the same question
What is it?
But you still wanna know but I already done did it
I ball heavy, the physics, it's all
But it's already specific
If we doing what's already done, that means it's already terrific
That's rather meta-poetic, and just to acknowledge that
As an extra exhibit to what's already within it
The gallery's like the wall space
So I made a gallery of galleries made of all space
If it was more small, it would be Moore's Law
From the land of the po' where we war Saw
From the hand of a pro to whore jaw
Make a stand to the store till the snow thaw
Went from paper boy to editor
From throwing Ars Poetica with the arms of Federer
On the porches and steps to the farm houses of settlers
One of several sects who can come and charm the predators
We who measure the measuring tools of measurers
We who pleasure the pleasure tubes of pleasurers
We who lecture at treasured schools of lecturers
We who question the cherished rules of leveragers
Born to death, born to die
Mourn correct immortalized
In a war, where your performance score is your salary
It's like fantasies combatting your mortality
I'm just trying to restore sanities
Sigmund Freud boy, Leroy to your vanity
To instill what kills krill destroys manitee
So heels spill but still seal deals that build factories
What looks Roman senator inner reveals macabees
Never just trust off guts, but what's actually
Unless it's quatos
Now, we back to pillars of salt
I recall back peeling potatoes
In hindsight, maybe a tank of killer tomatoes
A seasoned shoulder's carrying plenty pintos in payloads
Now, that's another strata but I was making sense
Then cop out, took the highway and I was making chips
A nappy-head Karate Kid, I was breaking bricks
Can fight like Tekken 5, even taking 6
This rehabilitation, I be taking trips
""Don't Ruin Us"" God said, I won't make a dent
Hardly, but I'm still Harvey
I hope this making sense
Devil tooting his own horn, don't come and take a sniff
In the streets you gotta fight, you get punished for taking whiffs
To make that change for your team, you gotta have New Jersey driving
A stomach for taking whips
I'm just trying to redeem
With these hands full of bars, don't beat me for coming clean
To unify the hooks
If you know it, then come and sing
Don't bust in while I'm sleep
Nightmares who come in dreams
Samurais rarely die from another sword
This is 1985 meets the hover board
That was Bobby Johnson potato, just the underscore
Think deep, but don't let it fry your motherboards
Dip teeth, so now the painting's plural
But this is Jr's Mural"
Ms Mural,Lupe Fiasco,"""If you had to paint the gutter, which color would you choose?""
Said the patron to the painter, the painter said, ""The blues""
Do you act off intuition or languish and peruse?
More like tap into tradition from the angle of my mood
He looked back at his canvas while strangling a tube
A master of the palette, all sanguine and cool
The music mostly jazz, the jazz mostly old
Punctured by some punk and some old smoky soul
An atlas on the trunk from the land of broken goals
Just a cover and a back that you open and you close
""Where are all the pages?"" The painter said ""Defanged
I ripped 'em all out and made some paper planes
Fish grease absorbers and some origami cranes""
Poured himself a drink and then poured it down the drain
Looked at the empty canvas, said I think I have a name
I'll call it ""Gasoline Pouring on the Flames"", hah, hah
I appreciate the visit, this isn't normally allowed
Do you consider yourself wild or conforming to a style?
The patron pointed at a pile, ""Are those rejections or mistakes?""
The painter said, ""That is not for question or debate""
Most of what we know as art is the projection of a faith
A product of a Pontiff for the election of a saint
A gift from the red for the digestion of the can't
A visual garnish for the confessions of the frank
Displays of physical carnage makes connections to the ranks
Goes over very well with South Americans and Yanks
Not to sound shamanistic but there's medicine in paint
It gets kinetic if you let it, there's a fetish in its strength
Martyrdom will call, Russian roulette is in the flanks
And most would pull the trigger if the weapons full of blanks
But when there's a pool of sharks and you step into the tank
That's the pool of art that got 'em headed to the plank
But they fell for the deceptiveness of the secularists complaint
The upheaval of the cathedral into the edifice of bank
That pile over there is just the evidence of angst
The failed revival of a perfectionist when his efforts have just sank
A selection of the waste that lacks direction or a base
You lose all of the plots for the affections of a race
Man does not become superior 'cause you connect him to a cape
Nor does become inferior because you connect him to a ape
I never wanted my life to be a collection of some dates
And holiday my days away and intellectually sedate
It's not really a beef but conceptually it's steak
Like do genitals and gender roles successfully conflate?
The current art world is just competitively opaque
It never ceases to amaze, my mouth is medically agape
One day its raising up the brand, the next it's shredding it to flakes
And the velocity of trends is what referees the pace
Professionally accept what ethically I hate
So in all of my work you see this wrestling with faith
Deceiving in the brushstrokes how aggressively I strafe
Less like putting on some makeup, more like severing a face
""Wow"", said the patron with a smile
That's the most interesting diatribe I've heard in a while
How you articulated the nature and put it all on trial
Took it up to heaven then put it on the ground
The painter asked the patron, ""Can you stand up on the pile?
I've had a flash of inspiration, my creativeness aroused""
The model took its place, the painter grabbed a lighter
Doused the shit in gasoline and set it all on fire
We got through the heart's of stone
And scars for bones
When your heart's unknown
In the arc of Joan, yeah"
Kick Push,Lupe Fiasco,"Ugh, what up y'all?
Yeah (Soundtrakk, what's poppin', baby?)
Y'all ain't know
I go by the name of Lupe Fiasco
Representin' that First and Fifteenth, yeah, uh
And this one right here
I dedicate this one right here
To all my homies out there grindin'
You know what I'm sayin'?
Legally and illegaly, haha (Uproxx)
You know what I'm talkin' about?
So, check it out, uh
First got it when he was six, didn't know any tricks
Matter fact first time he got on it, he slipped
Landed on his hip and busted his lip
For a week he had to talk with a lisp like this
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didn't quit, it was something in the air
Yeah, he said it was something so appealing
He couldn't fight the feeling, something about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it, couldn't understand it, brand it
Since the first kick flip he landed, uh
Labeled a misfit, a bandit (ka-kump, ka-kump, ka-kump)
His neighbors couldn't stand it
So he was banished to the park
Started in the morning, wouldn't stop 'til after dark
Yeah, when they said its getting late in here
So I'm sorry young man, there's no skating here
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push, coast
And away he rolled
Jus' a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push, coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be
So let's kick
And push
And coast
My man got a little older, became a better a roller
Yeah, no helmet, hell bent on killing himself
Is what his momma said but he was feeling himself
Got a little more swagger in his style
Met his girlfriend, she was clapping in the crowd
Love is what was happening to him now, uh
He said ""I would marry you
But I'm engaged to these aerials and varials
And I don't think this board is strong enough to carry two""
She said ""Bow, I weigh a hundred and twenty pounds
Now, let me make one thing clear
I don't need to ride yours, I got mine right here""
So she took him to a spot he didn't know about
Some modern apartment parking lot
She said ""I don't normally take dates in here""
Security came and said ""I'm sorry, there's no skating here""
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push, coast
And away they rolled
Just lovers intertwined with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push, coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel, looking for a place to be
So let's kick
And push
And coast
Yeah, uh (swanky)
Yeah, yeah
Before he knew, he had a crew that wasn't no punk
In they Spitfire shirts and SB dunks
They would push 'til they couldn't skate no more
Office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing they said (they said)
An escape route they used to escape out
When things got crazy, they needed to break out
They head to any place with stairs
Any good grinds, the world was theirs, uh
And they four wheels would take 'em there
Until the cops came and said ""There's no skating here""
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push, coast
And away they rolled
Just rebels without a cause with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push, coast
So come roll with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be
So let's kick
And push
And coast
Haha (swanky)"

Tryna get the tour bus with the studio
It ain't no bus, just booty hoes
Can't be out here looking like dookie when you're
Trying to start a movement that could mop on a movie role
Everything's polished, I didn't go to college
I was at the conference chopping with the djs
Trying to give my single on replay
And shit up on the game like colonics
Po' phone, take a flick with a fame for me
Hit the strip with a brick of the dance money
I'm tired, let's switch with the van for me
When I make it by, you'll print for the advance money

Hold up
Light man, turn the lights on
Came a long way from when I was holding the mic wrong
Something for the hood and a whole lot of white songs
Like I evolved to a whole 'nother life form
I'm just tryna make it happen
Don't attack that please
Can't find a job, you can rap at least
'Cause that's what I did, I was at that leg
Right out of high school, tryna stack that cheese
You was tryna do what? tryna stack that cheese
You wanna flip burgers, wanna stack that cheese
Make American singles, wanna stack that cheese
Make everybody smile, tryna stack that cheese
Tryna do it for a while, tryna stack that cheese
Talking frequent flyer miles, how I stack that cheese
Tryna bundle up the money, tryna stack that cheese

DRILL MUSIC IN ZION,Lupe Fiasco,"Yeah
The August symphonic, power of ablonic
To heal still, medical bill trill harmonics
Silver sonets from the Bonyuesian bonets
I leave a whole sleeve down in Condolese's comments
Cop a reebonix, competent and gannet
Godzilla's economics rock gondolas 'til you vomit
Bigger than the tongue and write signatures with a Thomas
Great Wall of China climber and Bonny will correspond it
Opera onyx, popular's for convicts
Stay below the doppler, turn robotics into sonics
Positioned jostlers, monitor hegemonics
Robots make the robots that solder the electronics
Nostradamus couldn't bother to keep a promise
Logic's on the rocket, what profit defeats a conscience?
Somebody's daughter is contemplating the convent
But a man with a dollar is slobbering for her honchos
Mouth is just watering for some nonsense
And this might be the moment her modeling probably launches
Gobbling collard greens through the rumpus
Washing gasoline, watch hollering, replace a congress
Golden gossiping auditing through my content
Running out of water, just pondering where the pond went
World's hottest summer, we're wondering if they pawned it
Desperate for the credits to come tumbling through the conflict, yeah
These episodes of the soul
Make me go past emote control
Can you make a ho' fold?
All the drill music in Zion
These episodes of the soul
Make me go past emote control
Can we make a ho' fold?
All the drill music in Zion
Now there are those that resoluted to wreck
Got caught, fought, lost, electrocuted to death
Came a little late for the rescue and the flesh
DNA exonerates posthumously whatever's left
No resurrection but reputation's correct
The revelation brings decorated regrets
All do respect, it's not really about fair
Collective sigh 'cause the real killer's still out there (there, there...)
Probably calling up police
Complaining 'bout his neighbors or just walking on the beach
Why should he have such views of the ocean?
And not be hanging from the gallows with his neck neatly broken?
I let it soak in, then I put the soap in
Then I put the boats in, then I play with both them
The hot tub's now lookin' like a yacht club
Makin' sure I get all of the shoes like a bot does
Neighbor is pissed
Tells the cops, ""If he wants to bathe like a sailor
Live on a container ship""
I party all night and the bangin' is intense
'Cause I know exactly what you did
And you gon' pay for it, you bitch
These episodes of the soul
Make me go past emote control
Can you make a ho' fold?
All the drill music in Zion
These episodes of the soul
Make me go past emote control
Can we make a ho' fold?
All the drill music in Zion
We'll end this shortly, story moral is the same
You either fly into the portal or put the portal over the plane
Coralling mortals is nothing short of insane
Let's try and turn this quarter water to a quarter bottles in Janes, haha
These episodes of the soul
Make me go past emote control
Can we make a ho' fold?
All the drill music in Zion
These episodes of the soul
Make me go past emote control

WAV Files,Lupe Fiasco,"Wade with us
Baptize and convert to the waves with us

I could never be a slave, people, they gon' have to pay me

Sonar, echo, location, and where we are facin'
Get back to our nation, oh Lord

Yes, jumped off the deck
To leave footsteps on the depths of the sea floor, ay

Dive with us, vibe with us
Imbibe with the tide
Sea salty 'cause it cry with us
When we looked it in the eyes
Like how could you help her?
But sigh and apologize and said that I'm sorry, we're shelter
Y'all can live down here forever
Drownin' and severed
From all your lungs and the lungs of your songs
Tell your daughters the water's a treasure
Summon the forest, talkin' the trees
Like how could you be in the chorus with something so horrid?
You became boards for the floors and the doors of the warships
Anthropomorphic, the forest returned with a match
Made from itself and said, ""Burn us with that""
Then left again and came back with an axe
We can serve you as furniture or furnace us black
My bones is where the beach is white

King Nas,Lupe Fiasco,"Ghetto, uh, uh
Ghetto (ghetto)
Ghetto (ghetto, yeah)
Ghetto, yeah (ghetto)
Uh
Ghetto mythologies colonize my mind constantly
To shine sonically in the Chi, divine comedy
I vibe consciously to override suicide
Inside, honestly 'cause they don't wanna honor me and honesty
Black king poetic with Nat King's aesthetic
Half dream, half machine with a black queen's
Get naked for a dollar from a scholar like me
Not at all bothered by what outsider might see
Flippin, a thousand grams get dissolved in the kitchen, heart wrenchin'
Heart wrenchin', part played, took away from my ascension
Crooked ways brought from car lookaways from tookin' J's
But it's too late for your prevention 'cause I'm playin' my position
I'm the man now (man now, man now, man now)
I'm the man, now
I'm the man, now
If you the man, let me see your fuckin' hands now
Not the man that keep your mother fuckin' hands down (man now)
I'm the man, now
Uh
Killer friends, dope dealers concealing sins
Sin and swim in my trunk like jumps deeper ends
We the gems, your daughter, we'll teach her hymns from the annals of
Crime channels that dismantle her once so we can mend, send 'em back
A livin', I'm feelin' trapped
We're no religion but brimming with brilliant facts
So we map, cast distorted role of a lady
With no control, let it go, hold onto baby
I wanna see it all
Never half asleep so people can't see the walls
'Cause of the masterpiece my data breach like hacker leaks
Delete the McAfees and slam the backdoors in back of me
Social engineer appears steer her to give a chat to me, happily
Actually activated off accolades of my apogee and act yakkity
Then deeply speak it back to me, then move it further
We can have a junta or a jerga
I smurf it and spoof the server, reboot and produce a cursor
I'm a man now (man now, man now, man now)
I'm the man, now

If you the man, let me see your fuckin' hands now
Not the man that keep your mother fuckin' hands down (man now)
Ghetto, ghetto
I'm the man, now
Deny the service and a little blue from the boycott
Advertise rum, space available on my toy box
But no sleepin' on me, dig deeper than reachin' shorties
Scheme for giant green, getting cream sweeter than bein' corny
Know the difference between bein' in love and bein' horny
Bein' hated, bein' human, bein' a team but bein' forty
They like to get 'em Young like I'm Brigham's son
Be more man that my attitudes, no ladder rather have a youth
Like the OGs pullin' Benzos out, they make 'em put
They pussies out like Fred Flintstone's house
Heart blacker than the back of Fred Flintstone mouth
I may be more like Barbara Casey, take the Timbo route to be a man now
I'm the man, now

If you the man, let me see your fuckin' hands now

A hypocrite I stated, though I only recited half
Omittin the word ""bitch, "" cursin I wouldn't say it
Me and dog couldn't relate, til a bitch I dated
Forgive my favorite word for hers and hers alike
But I learnt it from a song I heard and sorta liked
Yeah, for the icin, glamorized drug dealin was appealin
But the block club kept it from in front of our buildin
Gangsta rap-based filmings became the buildin blocks
For children with leakin ceilings catchin drippins with pots
Coupled with compositions from Pac, Nas's ""It Was Written""
In the mix with my realities and feelings
Living conditions, religion, ignorant wisdom and artistic vision
I began to jot, tap the world and listen, it drop
My mom can't feed me, my boyfriend beats me
I have sex for money, the hood don't love me
The cops wanna kill me, this nonsense built me
And I got noooo place to gooo
They bomb my village, they call us killers
Took me off they welfare, can't afford they health care
My teacher won't teach me, my master beats me
And it huuurts meee soooul
I had a ghetto boy bop, a Jay-Z boycott
'Cause he said that he never prayed to God, he prayed to Gotti
I'm thinkin golly, God guard me from the ungodly
But by my 30th watchin of ""Streets is Watchin""
I was back to givin props again and that was botherin
By this uncomfortable as a untouchable touchin you
The theme songs that people hustle to seem wrong but these songs was comin true
And it was all becoming cool
I found a condom on the ground that Johns would cum into and thought
What constitutes a prostitute is the pursuit of profit then they drop it
The homie in a suit pat her on the butt, then rock it
It seems I was seein the same scene adopted
Prevalent in different things with the witnesses indifferent to stop it
They said don't knock it, mind ya business
His business isn't mine and that people pimpin got it
They took my daughter, we ain't got no water
I can't get hired, they cross on fire
We all got suspended, I just got sentenced
So I got noooo place to gooo
They threw down my gang sign, I ain't got no hang time
They talk about my sneakers, poisoned our leader
My father ain't seen me, turn off my TV
'Cause it huuurts meee soooul
So through the Grim Reaper sickle sharpening
Macintosh marketing
Oil field augering
Brazilian adolescent disarmament
Israeli occupation
Islamic martyrdom, precise
Yeah, laser guided targeting
Oil for food barterin, terrorist organization harborin
Sand camouflage army men
CCF sponsorin, world conquerin, telephone monitorin
Louis Vuitton modelin, pornographic actress honorin
String theory ponderin, bullimic vomitin
Catholic priest fondlin, pre-emptive bombin and Osama and no bombin them
They breakin in my car again, deforestation and overloggin and
Hennessy and Hypnotic swallowin, hydroponic coughin and
All the world's ills, sittin on chrome 24-inch wheels, like that
They say I'm infected, this is why I injected
I had it aborted, we got deported
My laptop got spyware, they say that I can't lie here
But I got noooo place to gooo
I can't stop eatin, my best friend's leavin
My pastor touched me, I love this country
I lost my earpiece, I hope y'all hear me
'Cause it huuurts meee soooul"
Prisoner 1 & 2,Lupe Fiasco,"Mislaid plan make a mess made
Damnation, let's play hands and spades
That's without, a boycott and a sit-out
Afro-Black pick in with a fist out
From the ""welcome home"" to the kick out
Reach into a rabbit, pull a trick out
Preacher preaching to a faggot with his dick out
Hard times call for armed time
Sick, sick, sick eyes from the nose pressure
Police snip, zip ties on the protesters
Six wives in the fry of a molester
Met him at a caviar bar out in Odessa
Dirty needles breaking all the old records
A hundred hoes, one shovel and some old treasure
Ole Zeke use teeth as a gold tester
Finger rolls, finger waves, closet full of old leathers
Old sweaters, old boots, that's a whole suit for some cold weather
New sale, two L's and some old letters
Now he doing double life, while she lead a double life
Man, he need another wife
New approach might help a People bowl better
New hoes might help a People hold together
Or will the new lane lead em' to the same pen
And the hunger strike in em' to the same tin
Love is looking over various errors
And hate is habitually accelerating terror
I just wanna be collected when I call God damn
I don't wanna be accepted not as all as I am
Visitor, visitor, prisoner, prisoner, land
Getting slammed from the protest, no food
Force fed him like OB with a nose tube
Visions say consult the yogi with the gold shoes
With the Rollie going bowling for the old school
I need more for the Michaels
That's a loss for the class, and a score for the rifles
Three hots and a cot, and some cops
Trying to find dinosaurs in the Bible
It's all quiet in the jail-house
Then they ride in to find the empty cells out
They was looking for the swords, they was looking for the swords
I'm just looking at they feet, cause I'm looking for the lord
Looking in the library, looking at the law
10 years deep, now I'm looking at the bar
Claim sovereignty, because I'm bunkin' with the morons
They degenerate, they ain't looking at the game
They just looking at the scores, they be putting on my books
Cause I'm looking at the stars, trade a shank for some crank
Now I'm looking at a war, BGF got the yard
AV got the kitchen snitches on PC
Eminem on a mission, but CO's got the prison
God got us all, God set us free
God is the key, but the guards got the doors
Love is looking over various errors
And hate is habitually accelerating terror
I just wanna be collected when I call God damn
I don't wanna be accepted not as all as I am
Visitor, visitor, prisoner, prisoner, land
Punching on the glass, stare at some killer
Might fuck him in the ass
Staff getting rigid, wasn't gonna take away the visits
Segregate People by theyself and make 'em stay with it
Wicked, swung the shank around on a mop string
They had to pull him out the cell with a SWAT Team
That's a cop team, they sent hella cops, to stop, the helicoptering
Man, he thought that he'd fly away, like a kite, take flight
Like a letter on a string, like propellers on a wing
But they can't find the key
They made electric chairs for his dying days
Last meals, no appeals for him to try and stay
On Death Row like Suge and the late Pac
Maybe he could dig a tunnel out of A Block
And wear gloves for the razor-wired gate top
Scared thugs going crazy in a caged box
Looking at the world through the TV
And they gone, rapping over beats from the tabletops
Ay! That's how it is in a police state
When your life is just a number and release date
When you're rehabilitated so correctly
And let's hope that's how you're living when you're set free
Love is looking over various errors
And hate is habitually accelerating terror
I just wanna be collected when I call God damn
I don't wanna be accepted not as all as I am
Visitor, visitor, prisoner, prisoner, land
They sell they souls
They sell they selves
They ain't twelve, they old
People old as hell
Old as jail, old as cells
Sold so much salt, ain't no more salt on the shelves
You a prisoner too, you living here too
You just like us, til' your shift get through
You could look like us, you know shit get through
You should be in cuffs like us, you should get strike 2
You should get like life, you should get like woo!
You should get that twice! You should get refused
The open road, that's no parole, and no control
Over your own soul, so control, your own remote control, that your folks can hold
You better watch these People (en garde)
If it was up to me, I would never unlock these People
Wouldn't rehabilitate, man, I would just box these People and throw away the key
I'd throw away the key like the coast guard watching me
(I'd throw away the keys)
You better watch these People (en garde)
If it was up to me, I would never unlock these People
Wouldn't rehabilitate, man, I would just box these People and throw away the key
I'd throw away the key like the coast guard watching me
(I'd throw away the keys)
Better watch these People (en garde)
5th year with the DOC
You can see what's CO see
Robocop opt his COP
3 hots and a C-O-T
Lived in a small town, his whole life
Never left, soundin' like the hole, right?
Either working at the prison, or it's no lights
In the system working with the pol-ice
In the prison stripping People for rights
Got a malice, on the other side of the bars
Watching People get smart, watching People get strong
Watching People get home, he jealous
But deep down he jealous
With each sweep down, he tell us
With each peep down, he help us
Wrong one gon' knock his ass out though
It's why he gotta lock all the People out for
Warden told the boy he better calm down
Step back from the brink and put the bomb down
But how the whole world in your palm sound?
It's why they treat People like shit
Writing raps to the taps, keep the face mask on 'em these People might spit!
You better watch these People (en garde)
If it was up to me, I would never unlock these People
Wouldn't rehabilitate, man, I would just box these People and throw away the key
I'd throw away the key like the coast guard watching me
(I'd throw away the keys)
You better watch these People (en garde)
If it was up to me, I would never unlock these People
Wouldn't rehabilitate, man, I would just box these People and throw away the key

Dinosaurs,Lupe Fiasco,"So, where should we begin?
Maybe we should begin at the beginning
Sounds fine to me
Dinosaurs came in all colors
They were creatures with different features
Had to teeth to eat ya, they made beds called nests
And laid eggs after they had sex inside 'em
Whether they ate plants or meat is how you could divide 'em
And the Flintstones, they, they used to ride 'em
With tails particularly good for slidin'
But in real life, it probably didn't go down like that (rah)
They probably didn't sound like that, but maybe close
If we are to believe Noah, they didn't really know how to make boats
And they drowned like that
Via paleontology, fossily is how they mostly found like that
Bones in the stones, that's if you soil-dig
But if you oil-rig, they warm up the homes
Power up the cars
In Jurassic Park, it was a zone full of clones
They say they death came from the stars
That asteroid flew down and blowed up the grown
The babies too, the whole family
The entire Brady crew bit the dust like food from the floor
Just imagine one day
All the Cruncheroos was just removed from the store
And not just shooed off the stage, but booed off the tour
If they had lawyers, they coulda sued something for sure
Class actions when that happens, you know the rules
Objection sustained, wrap the snap and gets overruled
Respect the court, this ain't your condo in Toronto
They ran in packs, Brontosaurus ran in hers
Pterodactyls was the birds
The prehistoric conceptual source of the Mighty Morphin' combo
Word, uh, it gets rangerous
Come hit the museum if you wanna hang with us
But mostly just the skeletons
Now if you wanna use brain cave space as a metric for intelligence
Then Tyrannosaurus Rex wasn't the smartest of the smartest
But you wouldn't wanna box with the short-armed carnivorous martial artist
You ain't gotta be the sharpest saw to slice the sausage
Of the largest ninja star in all of Harlem
To carve a part into a target, if we arguin'
They say they where we get chickens from
So which came first, ancestors or the chicken's sons?
Skulls flows cross roads like tips and thumbs
In Bruce Lee's gi, tell me to freeze, I might kick your gun
Call it survivin' the ice age
Reptilian, how old?
'Bout two-hundred and forty-two million
Post-Cretaceous, their status was basically wiped from the face
Of our favorite little ball in the skies
Some were small, some were tall, some would crawl, some would fly
But we gotta thank 'em all
'Cause without them, we wouldn't have the malls of Dubai
But they also kinda gave us all a climate change
I ain't tryna blame, just sayin'
Sometimes they go by they science names
Megalosauroidea or Sauropodomorpha, whatever you wanna call 'em
Whether it be Grimlock, Yoshi or Earl Sinclair
Just remember at one time, this whole world was theirs
Hi kids
Da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da"
Blur My Hands,Lupe Fiasco,"From the floating death, to the fire of death
To a flower outside my grave and oh man
Were you just being polite with your hands?
Take time to learn me like court appointed attorneys
Restore the order, we either join or adjourning
Less you join I'm up performing the journey
In all earnest, I go so Bernie
Takes another People to turn me
Get it straight, I ain't late on states
I'm just sternly stating
How what I do, with grace takes another People to turn mean
My return means like blockbuster with a tick
And I ain't kind but I don't hit
So you starting at the end, that's the part where you begin
I skip the bullshit so we can start it where we win
Yeah, spoiler alert
I can hear you all saying ""boy you're a jerk""
But it's cool though, know we gotta rule yo
Get in, then we win and do it all again, ho
From the floating death, to the fire of death
To a flower outside of my grave and oh man
Were you just being polite with your hands?
And it really means I'm number one, and you're a fan
Well that's cool, cause I think you're number one too
Yeah that's cool, cause I think you're number one too
Yeah that's cool, cause I think you're number one
Now me and words, we made a deal, that I'm gon' keep 'em real
And they show me their secrets, I can even cop a feel
Victorious, can't match wit, with warriors
I match wig with wits, similarly can't mix matchsticks with forests'
Only you can prevent what I do
Only due can prevent what's my view
I match matchsticks with wicks
Wicker man, take a sip of liquor and
Spit the lip off warriors
And spit flames, People get in the gang ah
From the floating death, to the fire of death
To a flower outside of my grave and oh man
Were you just being polite with your hands?
And it really means I'm number one, and you're a fan
Well that's cool, cause I think you're number one too
Yeah that's cool, cause I think you're number one too
I think you're number one
It's road rage, without a roll cage
Takes courage to run on these roadways
I know you like ""no way"", but I'm a full race
All so every soccer Terry Fox moulding, go ahead
Don't stop, go ahead
Sitting in your car, just listening to the bars
And there's traffic all around and you feel like falling down
And the music that I'm spewing out, enough to calm him down
'Fore you know you watch your car with your briefcase walkin' round
And them dollars from the budget that went to S1 Production
And Sebastian on the hook, like being dug by Michael Douglas
So don't start that walk through Echo Park
My life's a one-on-one and you caught up in the jam
Just show some love back to your number one fan
From the floating death, to the fire of death
To a flower outside of my grave and oh man
Were you just being polite with your hands?
And it really means I'm number one, and you're a fan
Well that's cool, cause I think you're number one too
Yeah that's cool, cause I think you're number one too
I think you're number one"
Sabda rindu,Lyodra Ginting,"Malam-malam tak berbintang
Jadi terang menantikanmu

Kangen dirimu

Inikah Cinta,M.E,"Saat kujumpa dirinya
Di suatu suasana
Terasa getaran dalam dada
Kucoba mendekatinya
Kutatap dirinya
Oh dia sungguh mempesona
Ingin daku menyapanya
Menyapa dirinya
Bercanda tawa dengan dirinya
Namun apa yang kurasa
Aku tak kuasa
Aku tak tau harus berkata apa
Inikah namanya cinta
Inikah cinta
Cinta pada jumpa pertama
Inikah rasanya cinta
Inikah cinta
Terasa bahagia saat jumpa
Rindu terasa
Dikala diri ini ingin jumpa
Ingin selalu bersama
Bersama dalam segala suasana"
Kisah Sempurna,Mahalini,"Tenggelam, jiwaku dalam angan
Tersesat, hilang, dan tak tahu arah
Ku terjebak masa lalu yang kelam
Tak kulihat lagi cahaya cinta
Dan kamu hadir coba bawa bahagia
Ketika ku masih mati rasa
Kar'na
Dia yang pertama membuatku cinta
Dia juga yang pertama membuatku kecewa
Kamu yang pertama menyembuhkan luka
Tak ingin lagi ku mengulang keliru akan cinta
Jadi kisah yang sempurna
Tenggelam, jiwaku dalam angan
Tak kulihat lagi cahaya cinta
Dan kamu hadir coba bawa bahagia
Ketika ku masih mati rasa
Kar'na
Dia yang pertama membuatku cinta
Dia juga yang pertama membuatku kecewa
Kamu yang pertama menyembuhkan luka
Tak ingin lagi ku mengulang keliru akan cinta
Jadi kisah yang sempurna, wo-oh

Hati yang terkunci, terbuka kembali
Dia yang pertama membuatku cinta
Dia juga yang pertama membuatku kecewa

Tak ingin lagi ku mengulang keliru akan cinta

Dia juga pertama membuatku kecewa

Kamu untuk selamanya"
Pura pura lupa,Mahen,"Pernah aku jatuh hati
Padamu sepenuh hati
Hidup pun akan kuberi
Apapun kan ku lakui
Tapi tak pernah ku bermimpi
Kau tinggalkan aku pergi
Tanpa tahu rasa ini
Ingin rasa ku membenci
Tiba tiba kamu datang
Saat kau telah dengan dia
Semakin hancur hatiku
Jangan datang lagi cinta
Bagaimana aku bisa lupa
Padahal kau tahu keadaannya
Kau bukanlah untukku
Jangan lagi rindu cinta
Ku tak mau ada yang terluka
Bahagiakan dia aku tak apa
Biar aku yang pura pura lupa
Oh oh
Tiba tiba kamu datang
Saat kau telah dengan dia
Semakin hancur hatiku
Jangan datang lagi cinta
Bagaimana aku bisa lupa
Padahal kau tahu keadaannya
Kau bukanlah untukku
Jangan lagi rindu cinta
Ku tak mau ada yang terluka
Bahagiakan dia aku tak apa
Biar aku yang pura pura lupa
Jangan datang lagi cinta

Ku tak mau ada yang terluka
Bahagiakan dia aku tak apa (bahagiakan dia)
Biar aku yang pura pura lupa
Oh
Bahagiakan dia aku tak apa

LDR,Mahen,"Banyak cerita yang terjadi
Saat ku dengan mu
Ada bahagia canda tawa
Ada hati rindu
Jangan takut
Pasti bertemu
Tunggu nanti kita bersama lagi
Tunggu nanti pasti bertemu
Simpan dulu rasa rindumu kesalmu
Saat kita bertemu
Aku tau kau cemaskan ku
Saat ku tak ada disitu dekatmu
Simpan luka dalam rindu ho
Kesal rasanya
Berbalas pesan tanpa bertemu
Hanya lewat whatsapp
Habiskan malam milik berdua
Jangan takut
Pasti bertemu
Tunggu nanti kita bersama lagi
Tunggu nanti pasti bertemu
Simpan dulu rasa rindumu kesalmu
Saat kita bertemu
Aku tau kau cemaskan ku
Saat ku tak ada disitu dekatmu
Simpan luka dalam rindu

Foto Lama,Mahen,"Kamu yang ku percaya tak pergi
Ternyata, pergi
Dimana kamu yang dulu
Mengejar tuk mendapatkan aku
Datang dan pergi semau mu
Begitu caramu setelah dapatkan
Aku selalu kembali
Untuk kamu yang pergi
Melupakan mu ternyata sakit
Mencari pengganti mu sulit
Ternyata aku hanya takut sendiri
Bersamamu tak mungkin
Yang kudapati hanya kenangan foto lama
Ternyata patah hati
Bukan kisah yang menarik untuk diulang
Karna hal yang menyakitkan
Saat kamu tersenyum
Hanya untuk menggantikan air mata yang jatuh
Datang dan pergi semau mu
Begitu caramu setelah dapatkan
Aku selalu kembali untuk kamu yang pergi
Melupakan mu ternyata sakit
Mencari pengganti mu sulit
Ternyata aku hanya takut sendiri
Bersamamu tak mungkin
Yang kudapati hanya kenangan foto lama (ooh. foto lama)
Melupakan mu ternyata sakit
Mencari pengganti mu sulit
Ternyata aku hanya takut sendiri
Bersamamu tak mungkin (Bersamamu yang kudapat)
Yang kudapati hanya kenangan foto lama (Foto lama)"
Terbiasa Sendiri,Mahen,"Kembali ku salah
Buat hatiku lelah
Langit biru mulai berubah
Menjadi kelabu
Aku lagi yang terluka
Hatiku hanya untukmu singgah
Ternyata kita akhirnya berpisah
Tak ada lagi kata kita
Tak saling sapa
Dan tinggal hanya di sini, aku sendiri
Hoo, aku lagi yang terluka
Hatiku hanya untukmu singgah
Ternyata kita akhirnya berpisah
Tak ada lagi kata kita
Tak saling sapa
Dan tinggal hanya aku sendiri
Seolah janji kita selamanya
Nyatanya bohong belaka
Kau pergi
Dan aku di sini berteman sepi
Sudahi, jangan pernah kembali

Arloji,Mahen,"Salahkah ku disini
Menunggu dirimu
Menunggu cintamu
Hingga tanpa terasa
Lelahnya ku menunggumu
Terbangun dan terjaga
Ku dari lamunan itu

Walau detik jarum kan berhenti

Mimpi Tentang Dia,Mahen,"Kapan lagi kau ada di sini?
Menemani di setiap sepi
Ini aku, sedang merindu
Rindu tentang kamu
Malam, tolonglah, mimpikan tentang dia
Agar ku bisa lihat senyumannya

Putus Saja,Mahen,"Aku berjalan, kamu berlari
Aku berlari, kamu berhenti
Seakan kamu asing bagiku
Sudah begitu jauhkah hati kita?
Sudah begitu tawarkah cinta kita?
Sehingga dirimu tak pernah menganggapku ada
Ku seperti hujan di matamu
Sampai kau harus berteduh menghindariku
Kata ""Jodoh"" tak berlaku untuk hubungan kita
Ku seperti duri dalam daging
Bersama kita, tapi saling menyakiti
Jika sudah tak kuat, lebih baik putus saja
Aku berjalan, kamu berlari
Aku berlari, kamu berhenti
Seakan kamu asing bagiku, uh-uh
Sudah begitu jauhkah hati kita?
Sudah begitu tawarkah cinta kita? (Cinta kita)

Cinta Selesai.,Mahen,"Dalam perjalanan cinta, siapa yang tak terluka?
Jika s'gala yang kuberi tak pernah ada arti
Hingga akhirnya kau memilihnya
Lalu apa lagi, jika ingin pergi
Ku tak pernah mengerti hati
Tak mungkin lanjutkan ini
Harusnya memberi, bukan saling benci
Bukan patah hati
S'moga air mata terurai
Cinta t'lah selesai
Semua daya aku coba 'tuk pertahankan kita
Hingga akhirnya kau memilihnya
Jika kau bukan untukku
Ku hanya ingin kau tau bahwa
Setidaknya ku mencintai
Bukan 'tuk melukai
Lalu apa lagi, jika ingin pergi
Ku tak pernah mengerti hati (tak pernah mengerti hati)
Tak mungkin lanjutkan ini
Harusnya memberi, bukan saling benci
Bukan patah hati
S'moga air mata terurai
Cinta t'lah selesai
"
Luka Yang Kurindu,Mahen,"Lebih baik diam
Dan menghapus dendam
Tak lagi bicara
Agar tak semakin terluka
Cinta punya batas
Tak harus saling keras
Tak bisa di paksa
Segala yang kau ucap bohong
Kau lakukan omong kosong
Tak perlu lagi percaya
Kau hanya pura-pura
Kita di ujung perpisahan
Namun selalu ku rindukan
Kau luka yang ku rindu
Ho ho
Cinta punya batas
Tak harus saling keras
Tak bisa di paksa
Segala yang kau ucap bohong
Kau lakukan omong kosong
Tak perlu lagi percaya
Kau hanya pura-pura
Kita di ujung perpisahan
Namun selalu ku rindukan
Kau luka yang ku rindu
Lelah ku menangis (oh)
Terluka karnamu
Ini kekalahanku
Wo uwo wo oh
Pergi lupakanlah aku
Biar aku yang bertahan
Segala yang kau ucap bohong
Kau lakukan omong kosong
Tak perlu lagi percaya
Kau hanya pura-pura
Kita di ujung perpisahan
Namun selalu ku rindukan
Kau luka yang ku rindu
Kau luka yang ku rindu"
"Seamin Tak Seiman

Oh, Tuhan, ternyata hanya tak mungkin 'kan tersatukan
Kita adalah ketidakmungkinan yang selalu kusemogakan
Ditemukan namun salah

Berjalan salah, berhenti pun tak mudah
Apakah kita salah?
Ho-oh, ho-oh

Satu hal yang kutahu
Kita seamin tak seiman
Berbeda, berujar pada kata akhir yang sama

Jangan pernah datang lagi
Jika hanya berujung pergi
Tak perlu lagi perbaiki
Kau datang hanya untuk pergi
Jangan menyakiti
Jika tak mengobati (jika tak mengobati)
Jangan pernah datang lagi (oh)
Jika hanya berujung pergi
(Kau menyakiti, tak mengobati) tak perlu lagi perbaiki
Kau datang hanya untuk pergi
Kau datang hanya untuk pergi"
Beri Cinta Waktu,Maliq & D'essentials,"Dengarlah bisikku
Saat kumerindumu
Tetes air mata
Tak dapat sembunyikan rasa
Cintaku untuk dirimu
Bilakah kau tahu
Ketika kau jauh
Menangis hatiku
Setiap kumemanggil namamu
Tiada lagi hadir untukku
Bila kukatakan kini
Arti hadirmu di sini
Mungkinkah kau akan kembali
Bersama denganku
Beri cinta waktu
Untuk memahami
Untuk meyakini
Bila esok yang akan terjadi
Semua indah akan terjalani
Dengar bisikku kumerindumu
Kini kau jauh menangis hatiku
Masih adakah ruang hatimu
Untukku kembali"
Mariah Carey,Mariah Carey,"When you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
'Cause we belong together
Haha, remix, Desert Storm
Uh, yo, show your respect whenever you hear me or see me
(This is the emancipation of Mimi)
Hot like the real fever, the real diva
So successful, yet, still so eager
No matter what they say, it's on forever
(It's our time right now) more than ever
(To the death) we gon' get it on together
And MC, you know we belong together, come on
I lost a part of me
When you left, boy, can't you see?
Boy, come back, baby, please
'Cause we belong together
Who am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who's gon' to talk to me 'til the sun comes up?
Who's gon' take your place, there ain't nobody there
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together
I only think of you on two occasions
That's day and night (oh-oh)
I'd go for broke if I could be with you
Only you can make it right, make it right, make it right
We belong together like the sun in the summertime
Bounce in a lemon range (skip in a hummer lime)
(P and kiss, in and out) Mariah on the other line
Baby, I'ma come back (believe it'll come a time)
We belong together like peanut butter and jelly
Februaries and skellies, after parties and tellies
Feel you in my stomach like you a part of my belly
Baby, I'ma come back with every part of you ready
I lost a part of me
When you left, boy, can't you see?
Boy, come back, baby, please
'Cause we belong together
Who am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who's gon' to talk to me 'til the sun comes up?
Who's gon' take your place, there ain't nobody there
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together
I can't sleep at night when you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Saying to me, ""If you think you're lonely now, wait until tonight""
Boy, I'm feeling all out of my element, throwing things, crying
Tryin' to figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby (let's go)
You gon' need a shoulder to cry on
Classic Mustang Cobra to ride on
Past is the past, just let it be bygone's
Matter of fact, I know a fly song that we could vibe on
Let's get it straight
If it's the six or the quarter to eight
(Then I'm throwing Babyface or Shy on)
Yeah and Kiss, Ghost and MC
Get close and toast to the diva and MC's
Uh, the trees will blow
Big cups of Pinot Grigio (take it easy, though)
We belong together, we know that
Now I think that it's 'bout time we show that
Even though every moment won't be a Kodak (naw)
Sometimes we argue, I spaz out, grab my bozak
Come back not 'cause I have to, I want to
And naw, I don't just wanna have you, I want you, uh
I lost a part of me
When you left, boy, can't you see?
Boy, come back, baby, please
'Cause we belong together
Who am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who's gon' to talk to me 'til the sun comes up?
Who's gon' take your place, there ain't nobody there
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together
This is, the Desert Storm remix, haha (we belong together)
(Oh, baby, baby, we belong together)
DJ Clue, Desert Storm (oh, come back, baby, please)
We belong together (MC)
Oh, come back, baby, please (woo)
Is it so hard to believe? We belong together
We back, baby (oh, baby, baby, we belong together)
We belong together"
All I Want For Christmas Is You,Mariah Carey,"I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need (and I)
Don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking there upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy with a toy on Christmas Day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow (and I)
I'm just gonna keep on waiting underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it to the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
Oh-oh, all the lights are shining so brightly everywhere (so brightly, baby)
And the sound of children's laughter fills the air (oh, oh, yeah)
And everyone is singing (oh, yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh)
Won't you please bring my baby to me?
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby standing right outside my door
Oh, I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas (all I really want) is you, baby
All I want (I want) for Christmas (all I really want) is you, baby"
Love Takes Time,Mariah Carey,"I had it all, but I let it slip away
Couldn't see I treated you wrong
Now I wander around, feeling down and cold
Trying to believe that you're gone
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone (Ooh-ooh)
Losing my mind from this hollow in my heart
Suddenly, I'm so incomplete
Lord, I'm needing you now
Tell me how to stop the rain
Tears are falling down endlessly (Oh-oh)
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain inside
'Cause love takes time
And I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here, alone
You might say that it's over
You might say that you don't care
You might say you don't miss me
You don't need me
But I know that you do
And I feel that you do, inside (Oh, oh)
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I, I was so blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be there
I don't wanna be there, alone"
Heartbreaker,Mariah Carey,"Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
You gotta bounce to it like this
You almost gotta walk to this
Uh huh
Escape
Boy your love's so good
I don't want to let go
And although I should
I can't leave you alone
'Cause you're so disarming
I'm caught up in the midst of you
And I can not resist, and oh
Boy if I do
The things you want me to
The way I used to do
Would you love me, baby
Hold me, feeling now
Go and break my heart
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh why, did you have to run your game on me
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart
Give me your love, give me your love
Give me your love, give me your love
Give me your love, give me your love
Give me your love, give me your love
Give me your love, give me your love
Give me your love, give me your love
Give me your love, give me your love
Give me your love, give me your love
It's a shame to be so euphoric and weak
When you smile at me
And you tell me the things that you know
Persuade me to relinquish my love to you
But I can not resist at all
Boy if I do
The things you want me to
The way I used to do
Would you love me, baby
Hold me, feeling now
Go and break my heart
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh why, did you have to run your game on me
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart
She want to shop with Jay, play box with Jay
She want to pillow fight in the middle of the night
She want to drive my Benz with five of her friends
She want to creep past the block spyin' again
She want to roll with Jay, chase the skeeos away
She want to fight with lame chicks, blow my day
She want to inspect the rest, kick me to the curb
If she find a strand of hair longer than hers
She want love in the jacuzzi, rub up in the movies
Access to the old crib, keys to the new crib
She want to answer the phone, tattoo her arm
That's when I gotta send her back to her moms
She call me ""Heartbreaker""
When we apart, it makes her
Want to get a piece of paper, scribble ""I hate ya""
But she know she love Jay because
She love everything Jay say, Jay does and uh
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh why, did you have to run your game on me
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh why, did you have to run your game on me
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh why, did you have to run your game on me
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh why, did you have to run your game on me
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart
Give me your love, give me your love
Give me your love, give me your love"
Emotions,Mariah Carey,"You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
I feel good
I feel nice
I've never felt so satisfied
I'm in love
I'm alive
Intoxicated
Flying high
It feels like a dream
When you touch me tenderly
I don't know if it's real
But I like the way I feel inside
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
In the morning when I rise
You are the first thing on my mind
And in the middle of the night
I feel your heartbeat next to mine
It feels like a dream
When you love me tenderly
I don't know if you're for real
But I like the way I feel inside
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
You know the way to make me lose control
When you're looking into my eyes
You make me feel so high
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
You've got me feeling emotions, yes you do
You've got me feeling emotions, yeah
You've got me feeling higher"

'Cause you've flown away so faraway ay-ay-ay-ay
Never had I imagined your living without your smile...

So I hope Rudolph and them other eight reindeer
Get you safely here
So you can scoop him up
And scoop him right down my chimney
I've been really, really, really good this year
So put on that red suit and make him appear
Make this Christmas cheer
Just ain't the same without my baby
Come on, oh, Kris Kringle send me-
They say it's unrealistic

So grant this wish for me right quick

The trees all sparkly and gold
But inside I feel so cold
So soon as you leave the North Pole
Santa won't you come and make him mine this Christmas?

My All,Mariah Carey,"I am thinking of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won't let me be right
'Cause I've drowned in you
And I won't pull through
Without you by my side
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight
Baby can you feel me
Imagining I'm looking in your eyes
I can see you clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind
And yet you're so far
Like a distant star
I'm wishing on tonight
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on

You're delusional, you're delusional
Boy you're losing your mind
It's confusing yo', you're confused you know
Why you're wasting your time?
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex
Seeing right through you like you're bathing in Windex

Gasping for air

Telling the world how much you miss me
But we never were
So why you trippin'?

The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Saviour's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O night
When Christ was born
O night divine
O night
O night divine
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O night
When Christ was born
O night divine
O night divine
Ooh, yes it was
(O night divine) oh, it is the night of our dear Savior's birth
(O night divine) oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
(O night divine) it was a long night, long night, long night
(O night divine) yes it was"
Fantasy,Mariah Carey,"Oh, when you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kinda hectic inside
Mmm, baby I'm so into you
Darling, if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind
But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby
Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly
As you're going to my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again
But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby
Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby
I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend
My laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning
And there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming
But I'm not sleeping
Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby
Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby
Sweet sweet fantasy baby
Sweet sweet fantasy baby"
When You Believe,Mariah Carey,"Many nights we prayed
With no proof, anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song
We barely understood
Now, we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains
Long before we knew we could, whoa, yes
There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve?
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe
Oh-oh-oh
Mmm, yeah
In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer bird
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here
My hearts so full, I can't explain
Seeking faith and speakin' words
I never thought I'd say
There can be miracles
When you believe (When you believe)
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill (Mmm)
Who knows what miracles you can achieve? (You can achieve)
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe
They don't always happen when you ask
And it's easy to give in to your fears
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see the way, get through the rain
A small but still, resilient voice
Says, help is very near, oh (Oh)
There can be miracles (Miracles)
When you believe (Boy, when you believe, yeah)
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill (Hard to kill, oh, yeah)
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve (You can achieve, oh)
When you believe somehow you will (Somehow, somehow, somehow)
Now, you will (I know, I know, know)
You will when you (When you)
Believe
You will when you (You will when you)
Believe
Just believe (Believe)
Just believe
You will when you
Believe"
Hero,Mariah Carey,"There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand
For you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And that emptiness you felt
Will disappear
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you, oh, oh
Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away, hey yeah
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time you'll find the way
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you
Mmm, that a hero lies in you"
Without You,Mariah Carey,"No, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows
No, I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't give
I can't give anymore
Well, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
No, no, no, no, I can't live
(No, can't live)
If living is without you (no, I can't live)
I can't live
I can't give anymore
Can't live (no, can't live)
(No, I can't live)"
Angels Cry,Mariah Carey,"I shouldn't have walked away
I would've stayed if you'd say
We could've made everything okay, but we just
Threw the blame back and forth, we treated love like a sport
The final blow hit so low, I'm still on the ground
I couldn't have prepared myself for this fall
Shattered in pieces, curled on the floor
Super natural love conquers all, remember we
Used to touch the sky
And lighting don't strike
The same place twice, when you and I
Said goodbye I felt the angels cry
True love's a gift,
But we let it drift in a storm
Every night I feel the angels cry
C'mon babe, can't our love be revived?
Bring it back and we gon' make it right
I'm on the edge, just tryin' to survive
As the angels cry
Limitless omnipresent, kind of love
Couldn't have guessed it would just stop and disappear
In a whirlwind
Here I am walkin' on this narrow rope wobbling
But won't let go, waitin' for a glimpse of the sun's glow
I know I can stand just pull me back up
Like there ain't no hurricane it's just us
I'm willing to live and die for our love
Baby, we can get back that shine
'Cause lighting don't strike, the same place twice
When you and i, said goodbye, I felt the angels cry
'Cause true love's a gift, but we let it drift, in a storm
Every night, I feel the angels cry
C'mon babe, can't our love be revived
Bring it back and we gon' make it right
I'm on the edge, just tryin' to survive
As the angels cry
Baby, I'm missin' you, don't allow love to lose (don't let our love)
We gotta ride it through
I'm reaching for you (baby I'm missin' you)
Baby, I'm missin' you, don't allow love to lose (you can)
We gotta ride it through, (we gotta ride it)
I'm reaching for you (and I'm gonna say)
Ou lighting don't strike, the same place twice
You and i, said goodbye, felt the angels cry
'Cause true love's a gift, we let it slip, in a storm
Every night, I feel the angels cry
Oh babe don't let the angels cry"
So In Love,Marion Jola,"Tersenyum ku tenggelam, dalam pelukanmu
Di bawah sinar mentari hati kita menari
Sambut musim cinta bersemi
Kau dan aku mungkin tahu cinta kita satu
Hadirmu selama ini kunanti
Melukiskan senyum di hati
Serasa ku di alam mimpi
Hingga waktu terhenti
Kuingin engkau ada disini
Kau dan aku mungkin tahu cinta kita satu"
Harder to Breathe,Maroon 5,"How dare you say that my behavior's unacceptable?
So condescending, unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step, 'cause if I do you'll need a miracle
You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
This double vision I was seein' is finally clear
Want to stay, but you know very well, I want you gone
Not fit to fu- tread the ground that I am walkin' on
When it gets cold outside, and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean
When I say there's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe
What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better, you never listened to a word I said
Clutchin' your pillow and writhin' in a naked sweat
Hoping somebody, someday will do you like I did
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean
When I say there's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Said, is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe
Said, is there anyone out there?
Does it kill? Does it burn?
Is it painful to learn that it's me that has all the control?
Does it thrill? Does it sting?
When you feel what I bring, and you wish that you had me to hold
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean
When I say there's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Said, is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe, no, no, yeah
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe, yeah"
Love Somebody,Maroon 5,"I know your insides are feeling so hollow
And it's a hard pill for you to swallow, yeah
But if I fall for you, I'll never recover
If I fall for you, I'll never be the same
I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only half way there
But you can take me all the way, if you take me all the way
I really wanna touch somebody
I think about you every single day
I know we're only half way there
But you can take me all the way, you can take me all the way
You're such a hard act for me to follow
Love me today don't leave me tomorrow, yeah
But if I fall for you, I'll never recover
If I fall for you, I'll never be the same
I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only half way there
But take me all the way, if you can take me all the way
I really wanna touch somebody
I think about you every single day
I know we're only half way there
But you can take me all the way, if you can take me all the way
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh
I don't know where to start, I'm just a little lost
I wanna feel like we're never gonna ever stop
I don't know what to do, I'm right in front of you
Asking you to stay, you should stay, stay with me tonight, yeah
I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only half way there
But take me all the way, if you can take me all the way
I really wanna touch somebody
I think about you every single day
I know we're only half way there

Makes Me Wonder,Maroon 5,"I wake up, blood-shot eyes
Struggled to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry
It feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath, after that, after that
Try to get you back
I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
Yeah, so, this is goodbye
God damn, my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I've left unsaid
I want to dive into you
Forget what you're going through
I get behind, make your move
Forget about the truth
I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try
And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
Oh, no, so, this is goodbye
Ooh, I've been here before
One day I'll wake up and it won't hurt anymore
You caught me in a lie, I have no alibi
The words you say don't have a meaning
'Cause I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you and I
And so, this is goodbye
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try, yeah
And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
Oh, no, so, this is goodbye
Oh, no, so, this is goodbye
Oh, no, yeah, so, this is goodbye
Oh, no, yeah, so, this is goodbye"
Won't Go Home Without You,Maroon 5,"I asked her to stay
But she wouldn't listen
And she left before I had the chance to say, oh
The words that would mend
The things that were broken
But now it's far too late, she's gone away
Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking: ""Why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?""
Hard to believe that
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
The taste of her breath
I'll never get over
The noises that you made kept me awake
Oh
The weight of the things that remained unspoken
Built up so much it crushed us everyday
Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking: ""Why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?""
Hard to believe that
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
Of all the things I felt but never really shown
Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go
I should not ever let you go, oh, oh, oh
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
Oh, oh, oh
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
And I won't go home without you
And I won't go home without you
And I won't go home without you"
Cold,Maroon 5,"Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold
Are we taking time or a time out?
I can't take the in between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to fuck with me
Acting like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?
Distant when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby tell me how did you get so...
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
Whoa yeah
Whoa yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold
What you holdin' on, holdin' on for?
If you wanna leave just leave
Why you wanna bite your tongue for?
The silence is killing me
Acting like we're not together
If you don't want this, then what's the use?
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?
Distant (oh) when we're kissing (yeah)
Feel so different (yeah)
Baby tell me how did you get so...
Cold enough to chill my bones

(So cold it's colder) Whoa yeah
(So cold it's colder) Whoa yeah
(So cold it's colder)
I don't understand why you're so cold
Never thought that you were like this
I took the tag off and made you priceless
I just spent half a mill' on a chandelier
Now you tryna cut me off like a light switch, yeah
Tryna stay, and I leave
Saying that you need some time to breath
Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four letter word
But the four letter word don't sleep
We goin' two separate ways
You ain't been acting the same
You gotta go, but the way your ass used to be
You gold dig every day
I split the four talk to the two talk
'Cause I can't let my job be hear what you say
Girl I tried to give you space
Baby tell me how did you get so cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

Sunday Morning,Maroon 5,"Yeah
Sunday morning, rain is falling
Steal some covers, share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in
But things just get so crazy
Living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you
That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
Well I never want to leave

Change the weather still together when it ends

Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

Oh yeah
But things just get so crazy living
Life gets hard to do (life gets hard)
Sunday morning rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing someday it'll bring me back to you,

Beautiful Goodbye,Maroon 5,"I count the ways I let you down
On my fingers and toes but I'm running out
Clever words can't help me now
I grip you tight but you're slipping out
And I remember your eyes were so bright
When I first I met you, so in love that night
And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry
Beautiful goodbye (Bye, bye)
It's dripping from your eyes (Bye, bye)
Your beautiful goodbye, oh (Bye, bye)
It's dripping from your eyes (Bye, bye), oh yeah
When did the rain become a storm?
When did the clouds begin to form?
Yeah, we got knocked off course by a natural force
And well, we'll be swimming when it's gone
And I remember your eyes were so bright
When I first met you, so in love that night
And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry
Beautiful goodbye (Bye, bye)
It's dripping from your eyes (Bye, bye)
Your beautiful goodbye, oh (Bye, bye)
It's dripping from your eyes (Bye, bye), oh yeah
All the pain you try to hide
Shows through your mascara lines
As they stream down from your eyes
And let them go, let them fly
Holding back, won't turn back time
Believe me I've tried
And your eyes were so bright
And I remember your eyes were so bright
I remember your eyes were so bright
When I first met you, how in love were we that night
And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight

Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved

Tap on my window, knock on my door, I want to make you feel beautiful

Payphone,Maroon 5,"I'm at a payphone trying to call home

Where have the times gone?
Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time, when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone?
Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If ""happy ever after"" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick, oh
You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I've said it before

I've wasted my nights

One more fucking love song, I'll be sick
Now I'm at a payphone
Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money while you sitting round
Wondering why wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom, now when you see me I'm strutting
And all of my cars start with a push of a button
Telling me the chances I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my show you can tell it I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could have saw, but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled valet open doors
Wiz like go away got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want, so you can go
And take that little piece of shit with you
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home

I was there for you in your darkest times
I was there for you in your darkest night

And I don't know if it'll ever be okay to show

Sometimes I wonder if I disappear
Would you ever turn your head and look
To see if I'm gone
'Cause I fear
There is nothing left to say to you
That you want to hear
That you want to know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful
You're just an innocent
A helpless victim of a spider's web
And I'm an insect
Going after anything that I can get
So you'd better turn your head and run
And don't look back
'Cause I fear
There is nothing left to say to you
That you want to hear
That you want to know
I think I should go

Treated you bad
Strung you along

The Sun,Maroon 5,"After school
Walking home
Fresh dirt under my fingernails
And I can smell hot asphalt
Cars screech to a halt to let me pass
And I cannot remember
What life was like through photographs
And trying to recreate images life gives us from our past
And sometimes it's a sad song
But I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away
Make every day
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And Mama I've been cryin'
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, ""The battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun""
Oh whoa, yeah
Now, moving on down my street
I see people I won't ever meet
I think of her and take a breath
Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps
And sometimes it's a sad song
But I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away
Make every day
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And Mama I've been cryin'
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, ""The battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun""
The rhythm of her conversation
The perfection of her creation
The sex she slipped into my coffee
The way she felt when she first saw me
Hate to love and love to hate her
Like a broken record player
Back and forth and here and gone
And on and on and on and on
I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away
Make every day
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And Mama I've been cryin'
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, ""The battle's almost won
And we're only several miles
Said, the battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun""

Sweetest Goodbye,Maroon 5,"Where you are seems to be
As far as an eternity
Outstretched arms open hearts
If it never ends then when do we start?
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever did receive
Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you come back
I have something to say
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home?
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I...
Dream away everyday
Try so hard to disregard
The rhythm of the rain that drops
And coincides with the beating of my heart
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
And I know you understand
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever did receive
Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you come back
I have something to say
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home?
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel, feel, feel, feel
Pushing forward and arching back

Secret,Maroon 5,"Watch the sunrise
Say your goodbyes

No contemplation

Your hold is strong
Please don't ever let it go, oh no
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad

Oh, can they keep it?
Oh, no they can't
I'm driving fast now
Don't think I know how to go slow
Oh where you at now?
I feel around
There you are
Cool these engines
Calm these jets
I ask you, how hot can it get?
And as you wipe off beads of sweat
Slowly, you say, I'm not there yet
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
Oh, can they keep it?
Oh, no they can't
I know I don't know you

Must Get Out,Maroon 5,"I've been the needle and the thread

And making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you cry, yeah

Tiba-Tiba Cinta Datang,Maudy Ayunda,"Tiba-tiba cinta datang kepadaku
Saat kumulai mencari cinta
Tiba-tiba cinta datang kepadaku
Kuharap dia rasakan yang sama
Ada sesuatu saat kumelihat dia
Ada getaran membuatku rindu
Senang hatiku saat kudengar suaranya
Ingin selalu ada di dekatnya
Saat ku sendiri kubayangkan dia
Datang padaku dengan cinta
Di keramaian kumerasa sepi
Saat tak ada dirinya"

You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me
She's saying, ""That's okay
Hey, baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need
She looked me deep in the eyes
She touchin' me so to start
She says there's no turnin' back""
She trapped me in her heart
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Let me be
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
She likes the boys in the bands
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan, after the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors, for those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree
She's saying, ""That's okay
Hey, baby, do what you want
I'll be your night lovin' thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
I don't care what you say
I wanna go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star""
Dirty Diana, nah

It's Dia-aa-aa... come on
She said, ""I have to go home
'Cause I'm real tired you see
Now I hate sleepin' alone
Why don't you come with me?""
I said, ""My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright""
Diana walked up to me
She said, ""I'm all yours tonight""
And then I ran to the phone
Sayin', ""Baby I'm alright""
I said, ""But unlock the door""
'Cause I forgot the key
She said, ""He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me""

Thriller,Michael Jackson,"It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller, ow
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (thriller night, babe)
The foulest stench's in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
Are closing in to seal your doom (oh, yeah)
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with 40 eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller (ooh-ooh), thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a
Killer, thriller, killer, thriller here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller (ooh-ooh), thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller, ow"
Smooth Criminal,Michael Jackson,"As he came into the window was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment, he left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table, he could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom, she was struck down
It was her doom
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
You've been hit by
You've been hit by
A smooth criminal
So they came in to the out way
It was Sunday, what a black day
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidations
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay? (Annie, are you okay?)

Billie Jean,Michael Jackson,"She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
You know what you did, (she says he is my son) breaking my heart babe
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover (don't Billie Jean)
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover"

Love me like a mother
Will you be there?
Weary, tell me will you hold me?
When wrong, will you scold me?
When lost will you find me?
But they told me
A man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight 'til the end, but I'm only human
Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused will you show it to me
You'll be there for me
And care enough to bear me

Black or White,Michael Jackson,"I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy is that girl with you?
Yes we're one and the same
Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none
And I told about equality and it's true
Either you're wrong or you're right
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Sew when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean
Protection
For gangs, clubs, and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places, faces
Where your blood comes from
Is were your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinkin' of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinkin' of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white
Ooh, ooh
Yea, yea, yea now
Ooh, ooh
Yea, yea, yea now
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by (yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by (yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white"

You wanna be tough, better do what you can

You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare

In The Closet,Michael Jackson,"There's something I have to say to you
If you promise you'll understand
I cannot contain myself when in your presence
I'm so humble
Touch me
Don't hide our love
Woman to man
She's just a lover who's doin' me by
Is it worth the giving? Is it worth the try?
You cannot cleave it or put it in the furnace

One thing in life you must understand
The truth of lust woman to man
So open the door and you will see
There are no secrets, make your move, set me free
Ah, because there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you, baby
Just promise me whatever we say (and we get it)
Or whatever we do to each other
For now, we'll make a vow to just (never knew)
Keep it in the closet
If you can get it, is it worth the try?
I really want it, I can't deny
It's just desire, I really love it
'Cause if it's aching, you have to rub it
She wants to give it

This passion burns inside of me
Don't say to me, you'll never tell
Touch me there
Make the move
Cast the spell
Ah, because there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you, baby

Heal the World,"Michael Jackson
","(Think about um, the generations
And ah, say we want to make it a better place for our children
And our children's children so that they, they
They, they know it's a better world for them
And think if they can make it a better place)
There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place it was brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow
There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me, and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
If you want to know why
There's love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares of joyful giving
If we try we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear of dread, we stop existing and start living
Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
Make a better world
So make a better world
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me, and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
And the dream we were conceived in will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this earth, crucify its soul?
Though it's plain to see, this world is heavenly
Be god's glow
We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares
We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me, and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me, and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
Heal the world (heal the world)
Make it a better place
For you and for me, and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
There are people dying

Make a better place for you and for me

Dangerous,"Michael Jackson
","The way she came into the place
I knew right then and there
There was something different
About this girl
The way she moved
Her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion
As she stalked the room
I could feel the aura
Of her presence
Every head turned
Feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive
The girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous
I never knew but I was
Walking the line
Come go with me
I said I have no time
And don't you pretend we didn't
Talk on the phone
My baby cried
She left me standing alone
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me
She came at me in sections
With the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her
Web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love
I was at the point
Of no return
Deep in the darkness of
Passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's
Strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive
This girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous
I never knew
But I was living in vain
She called my house
She said you know my name
And don't you pretend
You never did me before
With tears in her eyes
My baby walked out the door
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to god
'Cause I know how
Lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover
Friend of mine
I can not sleep alone tonight
My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope 'til it's all right
You and your manipulation
You hurt my baby
And then it happened
She touched me
For the lips of
A strange woman
Drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was
Smoother than oil
But her inner spirit and words
Were as sharp as
A two-edged sword
But I loved it
'Cause it's dangerous
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to god

Lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul

Arti Kehidupan,Mus Mujiono,"Ku menempuh sedalam lautan

Tapi pasti yang terakhir
Di cintamu kutemui arti hidupku"

Bagaimana dengan tidurmu?
Apakah masih terjerat aku?

Bagaimana dengan bangunmu?
Apakah masih berat tak mau?

Beribu cerita berbaris di sini
Akan ku simpan dalam hati

Hanya rasa yang seluruhnya

Menggenggam nafasku
Membelengguku
Katakan padaku ini tak benar

Selalu terangi gelap malamku

Memanggil tawamu terbang ke atas
Tinggalkan semua
Hanya kita dan bintang

Mungkin Nanti,Noah,"Saatnya ku berkata
Mungkin yang terakhir kalinya
Sudahlah lepaskan semua
Kuyakin inilah waktunya
Mungkin saja kau bukan yang dulu lagi
Mungkin saja rasa itu telah pergi
Dan mungkin bila nanti kita kan bertemu lagi
Satu pintaku jangan kau coba tanyakan kembali
Rasa yang kutinggal mati
Seperti hari kemarin saat semua di sini
Dan bila hatimu termenung
Bangun dari mimpi-mimpimu
Membuka hatimu yang dulu
Cerita saat bersamaku
Mungkin saja kau bukan yang dulu lagi
Mungkin saja rasa itu telah pergi
Dan mungkin bila nanti kita kan bertemu lagi
Satu pintaku jangan kau coba tanyakan kembali
Rasa yang kutinggal mati
Seperti hari kemarin saat semua di sini

Satu pintaku jangan kau coba tanyakan kembali
Rasa yang kutinggal mati
Seperti hari kemarin saat semua di sini
Tak usah kau tanyakan lagi simpan untukmu sendiri
Semua sesal yang kau cari semua rasa yang kau beri"
Khayalan Tingkat Tinggi,Noah,"Awal ku melihat
Ku yakin, ini bukanlah yang biasa

Seindah-indahnya
Tempat ku memikirkannya
Bila ku dapat, kusimpan wajahnya
Memegang indahnya
Berpura memilikinya

Sampai nanti
Tetap memegang tangannya

Hari yang Cerah untuk Jiwa yang Sepi,Noah,"Pagi biar ku sendiri
Jangan kau mendekat, wahai matahari
Dingin hati yang bersedih
Tak begitu tenang, mulai terabaikan
Hari yang cerah
Untuk jiwa yang sepi
Begitu terang
Untuk cinta yang mati
Ah-ah-ah
Kucoba bertahan dan tak bisa
Biru langit kelabuku
Tak begitu luas, seperti memudar
Kini tak terulang lagi
Di hari yang cerah, dia telah pergi
Hari yang cerah
Untuk jiwa yang sepi
Ah-ah-ah
Kucoba bertahan dan tak bisa
Ah-ah-ah
Mencoba melawan, kulepas
Hari yang cerah
Untuk jiwa yang sepi
Begitu terang
Untuk cinta yang mati
Ah-ah-ah
Kucoba bertahan dan tak bisa
Ah-ah-ah
Mencoba melawan, kulepas
Semua telah hilang

Menghapus Jejakmu,Noah,"Terus melangkah melupakanmu
Lelah hati perhatikan sikapmu
Jalan pikiranmu buatku ragu
Tak mungkin ini tetap bertahan
Perlahan mimpi terasa mengganggu
Kucoba untuk terus menjauh

Kucoba untuk lanjutkan hidup
Engkau bukanlah segalaku
Bukan tempat tuk hentikan langkahku
Usai sudah semua berlalu
Biar hujan menghapus jejakmu
Terus melangkah melupakanmu
Lelah hati perhatikan sikapmu

Melawan Dunia,Noah,"Kita adalah hati yang tertindas
Kitalah langkah yang berhenti berjalan
Kitalah mimpi yang tak terwujudkan
Senandungkan nada-nada yang indah
Kita memahami yang sesungguhnya
Dan tak harus menjelaskan semua
Tanpa pedulikan kata mereka
Kita berjalan melawan dunia
Hanya bisa bicara
Mereka tak beri jawaban
Tak perlu dengar kata mereka
Teruslah berjalan
Tak perlu dengar kata mereka
Teruslah berjalan
Kita adalah hati yang tertindas
Kitalah langkah yang berhenti berjalan
Kitalah mimpi yang tak terwujudkan
Senandungkan nada-nada yang indah
Ah tak perlu dengar kata mereka
Teruslah berjalan
Tak perlu dengar kata mereka
Teruslah berjalan
Tak perlu dengar kata mereka
Teruslah berjalan
Tak perlu dengar kata mereka
Teruslah berjalan

Lihat Langkahku,Noah,"Lihat langkahku
Tak lagi ku mengingat tentangmu
Tiada beban tersisa
Yang tertanam di jiwa
Rapuhkan cinta yang tlah membeku
Terang tlah membawaku
Menjauh dan hilang
Ku mengharapkan engkau
Jauh tak kembali
Bawa tangisan itu
Lihat langkahku
Tak pernah ku mengingat tentangmu
Jiwa ini tlah lelah
Dan semakin menyiksa
Tak pernah ku berharap kembali
Terang tlah membawaku
Menjauh dan hilang
Ku mengharapkan engkau
Jauh tak kembali
Bawa tangisan itu
Kau membalutkan perih
Sesakkan jiwaku
Hempaskan semua rasa
Ku mengharapkan engkau
Jauh tak kembali
Bawa tangisan itu
Kau membalutkan perih
Sesakkan jiwaku
Hempaskan semua rasa

"Ya, Kamu","Nosstress,Fendy Rizy,Wayan Sanjaya","Telah ku coba dan sungguh rumit kepala ini
Tak mudah sederhana
Entah berapa yang telah aku tulis
Namun rasa tiada yang berarti
Ternyata betapa susahnya
Menyusun lagu cinta untukmu
Ku pikir akan bakal mudahnya
Seperti kata lagu temanku
Ya apa susahnya uuu uuu
Ku coba lagi dan kali ini
Ku buka hati dan juga pikiranku
Namun ternyata berkata cinta
Susah bagiku walau hanya padamu saja
Ternyata betapa beratnya
Menyusun lagu cinta untukmu
Ku rasa tidak kalah beratnya
Seperti kala ku yang dahulu bertemu ayahmu
Namun satu yang ku paham
Dan ku harap kau pun juga
Cintaku walau tak terucap
Hanya padamu, ya hanya untukmu
Ya cuma kamu, cuma kita yang tahu"
Kisah Kasih Di Sekolah,"Obbie Messakh
","Resah dan gelisah
Menunggu disini
Di sudut sekolah
Tempat yang kau janjikan
Ingin jumpa denganku
Walau mencuri waktu
Berdusta pada guru
Malu aku malu
Pada semut merah
Yang berbaris di dinding
Menatapku curiga
Seakan penuh tanya
Sedang apa disini
Menanti pacar jawabku
Sungguh aneh tapi nyata
Tak kan terlupa
Kisah kasih di sekolah
Dengan si dia
Tiada masa paling indah
Masa-masa disekolah
Tiada kisah paling indah
Kisah kasih di sekolah
Malu aku malu
Pada semut merah

Night Changes,One Direction,"Goin' out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had she's showin' off
Drivin' too fast, moon is breakin' through her hair
She's headin' for somethin' that she won't forget
Havin' no regrets is all that she really wants
We're only gettin' older, baby
And I've been thinkin' about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you
Chasing it tonight, doubts are runnin' 'round her head
He's waitin', hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beatin' loud and she doesn't want it to stop
Movin' too fast, moon is lightin' up her skin
She's fallin', doesn't even know it yet
Havin' no regrets is all that she really wants
We're only gettin' older, baby
And I've been thinkin' about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you
Goin' out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Reminds her of the missin' piece of innocence she lost
We're only gettin' older, baby
And I've been thinkin' about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change, baby
It will never change, baby
It will never change me and you"
What Makes You Beautiful,One Direction,"You're insecure, don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need makeup to cover up
Being the way that you are is enough
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else, but you, ooh
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh-oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm lookin' at you, and I can't believe
You don't know, oh-oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh, oh-oh
That's what makes you beautiful
So c-come on, you got it wrong
To prove I'm right, I put it in a song
I don't know why you're being shy
And turn away when I look into your eyes
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else, but you, ooh
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh-oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately

Story of My Life,One Direction,"Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die, these words will be written on my stone
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I been holdin' on too tight
With nothin' in between
The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open, but it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning, I'll see us in the light up on the hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burnin' bright
The way that I've been holdin' on so tight
With nothin' in between
The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
And I've been waiting for this time to come around
But, baby, runnin' after you is like chasin' the clouds
The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen
The story of my life, I give her hope (give her hope)
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (the story of)
The story of my life
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

You & I,One Direction,"I figured it out
I figured it out from black and white
Seconds and hours
Maybe they had to take some time
I know how it goes
I know how it goes from wrong and right
Silence and sound
Did they ever hold each other tight like us?
Did they ever fight like us?
You and I, we don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between you and I
Oh, you and I
I figured it out
Saw the mistakes of up and down
Meet in the middle
There's always room for common ground
I see what it's like
I see what it's like for day and night
Never together
'Cause they see things in a different light like us
They never tried like us
You and I, we don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
(Two of us, two of us, two of us, two of us)
'Cause you and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between you and I

Something Great,One Direction,"One day you'll come into my world and say it all
You'll say we'll be together even when you're lost
One day you'll say these words I've thought but never said
You'll say we're better off together in our bed
I want you here with me like how I pictured it
So I don't have to keep imagining
Come on, jump out at me, come on, bring everything
Is it too much to ask for something great?
The script was written, and I could not change a thing
I want to rip it all to shreds and start again
One day I'll come into your world and get it right
I'll say we're better off together here tonight
I want you here with me like how I pictured it
So I don't have to keep imagining, oh
Come on, jump out at me, come on, bring everything
Is it too much to ask for something great?
I want you here with me like how I pictured it

Best Song Ever,One Direction,"Maybe it's the way she walked (wow)
Straight into my heart and stole it
Through the doors and past the guards (wow)
Just like she already owned it
I said, ""can you give it back to me?""
She said, ""never in your wildest dreams""
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line, now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes (ooh)
Said her name was Georgia Rose (wow)
And her daddy was a dentist
Said I had a dirty mouth (I got a dirty mouth)
But she kissed me like she meant it
I said, ""can I take you home with me?""
She said, ""never in your wildest dreams""
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line, now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
I think it went oh, oh, oh

And I know, you know, I hope you'll remember
How we danced, how we danced (one, two, one, two, three)
How we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line, now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night (we danced, we danced)
To the best song ever (it goes something like, yeah)
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line, now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes (ooh)
Best song ever
It was the best song ever
It was the best song ever

Strong,One Direction,"My hands, your hands
Tied up like two ships
Drifting, weightless
Waves try to break it
I'd do anything to save it
Why is it so hard to save it?
My heart, your heart
Sit tight like bookends
Pages between us
Written with no end
So many words we're not saying
Don't wanna wait 'til it's gone
You make me strong
I'm sorry if I say, ""I need you""
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong
That you make me strong?
Think of how much
Love that's been wasted
People always
Trying to escape it
Move on to stop their heart breaking
But there's nothing I'm running from
You make me strong
I'm sorry if I say, ""I need you""
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?
So, baby, hold on to my heart, oh
Need you to keep me from falling apart
I'll always hold on
'Cause you make me strong
I'm sorry if I say, ""I need you""
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?
I'm sorry if I say, ""I need you""
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?
That you make me...
I'm sorry if I say, ""I need you""
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong
That you make me strong?"
Perfect,One Direction,"I might never be your knight in shinin' armor
I might never be the one you take home to mother
And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
But I can be the one, be the one tonight
When I first saw you
From across the room
I could tell that you were curious, oh, yeah
Girl, I hope you're sure
What you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises
But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Then baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now
I might never be the hands you put your heart in
Or the arms that hold you any time you want them
But that don't mean that we can't live here in the moment
'Cause I can be the one you love from time to time
When I first saw you
From across the room
I could tell that you were curious, oh, yeah
Girl, I hope you're sure
What you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises

So let's start right now
And if you like cameras flashin' every time we go out
Oh, yeah
And if you're looking for someone to write your breakup songs about
Baby, I'm perfect
Baby, we're perfect
If you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down

18,One Direction,"I got a heart, and I got a soul
Believe me, I will use them both
We made a start
Be it a false one, I know
Baby, I don't want to feel alone
So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground
I have loved you since we were 18
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
All I can do is say that these arms
Are made for holding you, oh-oh
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were 18
We took a chance
God knows we tried
Yet all along, I knew we'd be fine
So pour me a drink, oh love
And let's split the night wide open
And we'll see everything we can
Living love in slow motion, motion, motion
So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground
I have loved you since we were 18
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
And all I can do is say that these arms
Are made for holding you, oh-oh-oh
And I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were 18
When we were 18
Oh, Lord, when we were 18
Kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground
I have loved you since we were 18
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
And all I can do is say that these arms
Are made for holding you
And I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were 18
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were 18
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were 18"
One Thing,One Direction,"I've tried playin' it cool
But when I'm lookin' at you
I can't ever be brave
'Cause you make my heart race
Shot me out of the sky
You're my kryptonite
You keep making me weak
Yeah, frozen and can't breathe
Something's gotta give now
'Cause I'm dying just to make you see
That I need you here with me now
'Cause you've got that one thing
So, get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
And you've got that one thing
Now I'm climbing the walls
But you don't notice at all (at all)
That I'm going out of my mind
All day and all night
Something's gotta give now
'Cause I'm dying just to know your name
And I need you here with me now
'Cause you've got that one thing

They Don't Know About Us,One Direction,"People say we shouldn't be together
We're too young to know about forever
But I say, ""They don't know
What they're talk-, talk-, talking about"" (talk-, talk-, talking about)
'Cause this love is only gettin' stronger
So, I don't wanna wait any longer
I just wanna tell the world that you're mine, girl, oh
They don't know about the things we do
They don't know about the I-love-yous
But I bet you if they only knew (they don't know)
They would just be jealous of us
They don't know about the up-all-nights
They don't know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right (they don't know)
Baby, they don't know about, they don't know about us
One touch, and I was a believer
Every kiss, it gets a little sweeter
It's getting better
Keeps getting better all the time, girl
They don't know about the things we do
They don't know about the I-love-yous
But I bet you if they only knew (they don't know)
They would just be jealous of us
They don't know about the up-all-nights
They don't know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right (they don't know)
Baby, they don't know about, they don't know about us
They don't know how special you are
They don't know what you've done to my heart
They can say anything they want
'Cause they don't know about us
They don't know what we do best
That's between me and you, our little secret
But I wanna tell 'em
I wanna tell the world that you're mine, girl
They don't know about the things we do
They don't know about the I-love-yous (I love you)

Little Things,One Direction,"Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me
But bear this mind, it was meant to be
And I'm joining up the dots, with the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me
I know you've never loved
The crinkles by your eyes when you smile
You've never loved your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
But I'll love them endlessly
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if I do, it's you
Oh, it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you
And all these little things
You can't go to bed without a cup of tea
And maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me
I know you never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much you weight
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you
It's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you
And all these little things
You'll never love yourself half as much as I love you
And you'll never treat yourself right darling, but I want you to
If I let you know, I'm here for you
Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you, oh
And I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth
'Cause it's you, oh, it's you
It's you, they add up to
And I'm in love with you
And all these little things
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you
It's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you
And all your little things"
No Control,One Direction,"Oh, oh, oh

Stained coffee cup
Just a fingerprint of lipstick's not enough
Sweet (ooh), where you lay (ooh)
Still a trace of innocence on the pillow case
Waking up
Beside you, I'm my loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I've got no control
No control
Powerless
And I don't care, it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed
No control
Oh, oh, oh
(Ooh)
The taste on my tongue
I don't want to wash away the night before
In the heat (ooh), where you laid (ooh)
I could stay right here and burn in it all day
Waking up
Beside you, I'm my loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I've got no control
No control
Powerless
And I don't care, it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed
No control
Lost my senses
I'm defenseless
Her perfume's holding me ransom
Sweet and sour
Heart devoured
Lying here, I count the hours
Waking up
Beside you, I'm my loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I got no control
No control
Powerless
And I don't care, it's obvious

History,One Direction,"You gotta help me, I'm losin' my mind
Keep gettin' the feeling you wanna leave this all behind

Aren't we?
No, they don't teach you this in school
Now my heart's breakin' and I don't know what to do
Thought we were goin' strong, thought we were holdin' on
Aren't we?
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh)
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh)
So don't let it go, we can make some more
We can live forever
All of the rumors, all of the fights
But we always find a way to make it out alive

Aren't we?
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh)
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh)
So don't let it go, we can make some more
We can live forever
Minibars, expensive cars
Hotel rooms and new tattoos
The good champagne, and private planes
But they don't mean anything
'Cause the truth is out, I realize
That without you here, life is just a lie
This is not the end, this is not the end
We can make it, you know it, you know
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh)

I Would,One Direction,"Lately I found myself thinking (thinking)
Been dreaming about you a lot (a lot)
And up in my head I'm your boyfriend (boyfriend)
But that's one thing you've already got
He drives to school every morning (morning)
While I walk alone in the rain (in the rain)
He'd kill me without any warning (warning)
If he took a look in my brain
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well, if it was me, then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby, you should know that I would, I would
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well, if it was me, then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby, you should know that I would
Back in my head we were kissing
I thought things were going alright (alright, alright)
With a sign on my back saying, ""Kick me""
Reality ruined my life (go Tommo, go)
Feels like I'm constantly playing
A game that I'm destined to lose
'Cause I can't compete with your boyfriend
He's got 27 tattoos
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well, if it was me, then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby, you should know that I would, I would
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well, if it was me, then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?

Would he kiss you?
Would he treat you like I would? (I would)
Would he touch you?
Would he need you?
Would he love you like I would?

Night Changes,One Direction,"Goin' out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had she's showin' off
Drivin' too fast, moon is breakin' through her hair
She's headin' for somethin' that she won't forget
Havin' no regrets is all that she really wants
We're only gettin' older, baby
And I've been thinkin' about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you
Chasing it tonight, doubts are runnin' 'round her head
He's waitin', hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beatin' loud and she doesn't want it to stop
Movin' too fast, moon is lightin' up her skin
She's fallin', doesn't even know it yet
Havin' no regrets is all that she really wants
We're only gettin' older, baby
And I've been thinkin' about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you
Goin' out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Reminds her of the missin' piece of innocence she lost
We're only gettin' older, baby
And I've been thinkin' about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change, baby
It will never change, baby
It will never change me and you"
Girl Almighty,One Direction,"Her light is as loud as as many ambulances
As it takes to save a savior (whoa whoa whoa)
She floats through the room on a big balloon
Some say, ""She's such a fake""
That her love is made up
No, no, no, no
Let's have another toast to the girl almighty
Let's pray we stay young
Stay made of lightning
Am I the only
Only believer?
There's something happening here
The only
Only believer
I get down, I get down, I get down
On my knees for ya
I get down, I get down, I get down
On my knees

Where Do Broken Hearts Go,One Direction,"Counted all my mistakes and there's only one
Standing out from the list of the things I've done
All the rest of my crimes don't come close
To the look on your face when I let you go
So I built you a house from a broken home
And I wrote you a song with the words you spoke
Yeah, it took me some time but I figured out
How to fix up a heart that I let down
Now I'm searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?
Yeah, the a taste of your lips on the tip of my tongue
Is at the top of the list of the things I want
Mind is running in circles of you and me
Anyone in between is the enemy
Shadows come with the pain that you're running from
Love was something you've never heard enough
Yeah, it took me some time but I figured out
How to fix up a heart that I let down
Now I'm searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?
Are you sleeping, baby by yourself?
Or are you giving it to someone else?
Try to find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?
Tell me now, tell me now
Tell me where you go when you feel afraid?
Tell me now, tell me now
Tell me will you ever love me again, love me again?
Now I'm searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?
Are you sleeping, baby, by yourself?
Or are you giving it to someone else?
Try to find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?
Tell me where you're hiding out
Where do broken hearts go?
Come on, baby, 'cause I need you now
Where do broken hearts go?
Tell me, 'cause I'm ten feet down
Where do broken hearts go?
Come on, baby, come and get me out
Come on, baby, come and get me out
Come on, baby, 'cause I need you now
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?"
Fireproof,One Direction,"I think I'm gonna lose my mind
Somethin' deep inside me, I can't give up
I think I'm gonna lose my mind
I roll and I roll 'til I'm out of luck
Yeah, I roll and I roll 'til I'm out of luck
I'm feelin' somethin' deep inside
Hotter than a jet stream burnin' up
I got a feelin' deep inside
It's takin', it's takin' all I've got
Yeah, it's takin', it's takin' all I got
'Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do
And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do
It's been so long, it's been so long
Maybe you are fireproof
'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you do
I think I'm gonna win this time
Ridin' on the wind and I won't give up
I think I'm gonna win this time
I roll and I roll 'til I change my luck
Yeah, I roll and I roll 'til I change my luck
'Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do
And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do
It's been so long, it's been so long
You must be fireproof
'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you do

Maybe you are fireproof

Happily,One Direction,"You don't understand, you don't understand
What you do to me when you hold his hand
We were meant to be, but a twist of fate
Made it so we had to walk away
'Cause we're on fire, we are on fire
We're on fire now
Yeah, we're on fire, we are on fire
We're on fire now
(One, two, three)
I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one who holds you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave, so come on, baby, be with me so happily
It's 4 a.m. and I know that you're with him

Better Than Words,One Direction,"Better than words, more than a feeling (ah, ooh)
Crazy in love, dancing on the ceiling (Huh!)

Don't Forget Where You Belong,One Direction,"Been a lot of places
I've been all around the world
Seen a lot of faces
Never knowing where I was
On the horizon
Mmh, well, I know, I know, I know
I know the sun will be rising
Back home
Living out of cases
Packing up and taking off
Made a lot of changes
But not forgetting who I was
On the horizon
Oh, well, I know, I know, I know
I know the moon will be rising
Back home
Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own
And the proof is in this song
I've been away for ages
But I've got everything I need
I'm flicking through the pages
I've written in my memory
I feel like I'm dreaming
Oh, so I know, I know, I know
I know that I'm never leaving
No, I won't go
Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own
And the proof is in this song
Lights off when they should be on
Even stars in the skies, they're wrong
Short days when the nights are long
When I think of the days I've gone
Don't matter how far I've gone
I'm always free to run home
Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong (don't forget it), home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own
Never, never, never
Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong (don't forget it), home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own (you were never)
And the proof is in this song
Home
Don't forget it
Home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own (you were never)
And the proof is in this song
Never forget it
This song
Don't forget it
No, I never forget it
This song
You were never"
Through the Dark,One Direction,"You tell me that you're sad and lost your way
You tell me that your tears are here to stay
But I know you're only hiding
And I just wanna see you
You tell me that you're hurt and you're in pain
And I can see your head is held in shame,
But I just wanna see you smile again
See you smile again
But don't burn out
Even if you scream and shout
It'll come back to you
And I'll be here for you
Oh I will carry you over
Fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer
Hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down on you
We will find a way through the dark
I wish that I could take you to the stars
I'd never let you fall and break your heart
And if you wanna cry or fall apart
I'll be there to hold you
You tell me that you hurt, it's all in vain
But I can see your heart can love again
And I remember you laughing
So let's just laugh again
But don't burn out
Even if you scream and shout
It'll come back to you, back to you
Oh I will carry you over
Fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer
Hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down on you
We will find a way through the dark
And you don't need
You don't need to worry
And you will see it's easy to be loved
I know you wanna be loved
Oh I will carry you over
Fire and water for your love
Oh I will carry you over
Fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer
Hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down on you
We will find a way through the dark
Oh I will carry you over
Fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer
Hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down
We will find a way through the dark"
Begitu Indah,Padi Reborn,"Bila cinta menggugah rasa
Begitu indah mengukir hatiku
Menyentuh jiwaku
Hapuskan semua gelisah
Duhai cintaku duhai pujaanku
Datang padaku tetap di sampingku
Kuingin hidupku
Selalu dalam peluknya
Terang saja aku menantinya
Terang saja aku mendambanya
Terang saja aku merindunya
Karena dia karena dia begitu indah
Duhai cintaku pujaan hatiku
Peluk diriku dekaplah jiwaku
Bawa ragaku
Melayang memeluk bintang
Terang saja aku menantinya
Terang saja aku mendambanya
Terang saja aku merindunya
Karena dia karena dia begitu indah"
Di Mana Hatimu,Papinka,"Inilah akhir cintaku, inilah akhir kisahku
Setelah kau jauh tinggalkan aku
Tak bisa ku melupakanmu, tak bisa aku tanpamu
Tak pernah aku rela kau tinggalkan aku

Tiada ku sangka engkau berubah
Ku tak percaya kau membagi cinta
Tahukah engkau betapa sakitnya
Kau membagi cinta karna dia

Tak pernah ku coba melupakanmu
Mengapa kau buat luka hatiku
Sekian lama aku menunggu
Kasih di mana hatimu

Tak bisa ku melupakanmu, tak bisa aku tanpamu
Tak pernah aku rela kau tinggalkan aku"
Masih Mencintainya,Papinka,"Jika teringat tentang dirimu
Berlinang air mataku
Ku rindu saat-saat bersamamu
Kasih sayangmu padaku
Namun kini kau bukan milikku
Dan berakhir sudah cintaku
Biarkan saja hatiku bicara
Ku masih sayang padamu
Aku selalu mendoakanmu
Agar kau bahagia
Bersama dirinya
Selamanya
Mengapa mudahnya hatimu mendua
Ku lapangkan dada walau aku terluka
Semoga bahagia bersama dirinya
Karena kau telah memilih dia
Betapa sakitnya apa yang ku rasa
Tuhan kuatkanlah hatiku yang terluka
Semoga kubisa tuk melupakannya
Karena ku masih mencintainya
Namun kini kau bukan milikku
Dan berakhir sudah cintaku
Biarkan saja hatiku bicara
Ku masih sayang padamu
Aku selalu mendoakanmu
Agar kau bahagia
Bersama dirinya
Selamanya"
Cinta dan Luka,Papinka,"Betapa hancur hatiku
Bila ku mengingat kamu
Tiada kusangka teganya dirimu
Kau khianati cintaku
Bagaimana caranya untuk
Melupakan tentang kamu
Agar tak terus merasa rindu
Rindu yang terus mengganggu
Kini cintaku berubah benci kepadamu
Maafkan aku tak lagi menginginkamu
Kau berikan cinta
Tapi kau juga memberi luka
Luka yang buatku menyatakan
Keinginan tak ingin bertahan
Tak pernah ku minta
Kau beralih mencintai dia
Kurang apa harus bagaimana semestinya
Agar bisa buatmu bahagia
Bagaimana caranya untuk
Melupakan tentang kamu
Agar tak terus merasa rindu
Rindu yang terus mengganggu
Kini cintaku berubah benci kepadamu
Maafkan aku tak lagi menginginkamu"
Aku Masih Cinta,Papinka,"Sudah terlalu lama
Kau pergi tinggalkanku
Ku sudah terlalu lama tanpamu
Sejak kau tinggalkanku
Hidupku tak menentu
Karena sesungguhnya ku tak mampu
Mudah saja kau berubah
Kau tinggalkanku untuk selamanya
Mengertilah ku tak bisa
Kerna sesungguhnya di dalam hatiku
Aku masih cinta kepada dirimu
Aku takkan bisa
Aku takkan mampu tuk melupakanmu
Hanya karena dia kau meninggalkanku
Kau membagi cinta di depan mataku
Tuhan tolonglah
Kuatkan hatiku
Sudah terlalu lama
Kau pergi tinggalkanku"
Dirimu Bukan Untukku,Papinka,"Andai kau dapat rasakan hatiku
Rasa cintaku padamu
Kau yang selalu menduakanku
Sungguh terluka hatiku
Sekian lama kumemendam rasa
Rasa hati yang terluka
Tapi bila kau bahagia
Rela kumelepaskanmu
Karena cinta dalam hatimu
Semua itu memang bukanlah untukku
Bahagialah selalu dalam hidupmu
Bila kau mencintainya
Tak bisa kumelupakanmu
Diriku yang menyayangimu
Kau yang dulu yang selalu 'ku rindu
Dirimu bukanlah yang dulu
Tak pernah kumelupakanmu
Diriku yang mencintaimu
Semoga selalu bahagia hidupmu
Dirimu bukanlah untukku"
Sampai Hatimu,Papinka,"Cinta ini yang kauberikan
Namun, sakit yang kurasakan
Kau permainkan, engkau lupakan
Itu yang kaulakukan
Hingga kini ku merasakan
Sakit hati yang kau berikan
Coba bertahan, terus bertahan
Apa yang kurasakan
Sakit, sungguh sakit rasa hati ini
Kini kau t'lah pergi dan takkan kembali
Sampai hatimu permainkan diriku
Mencintaimu, sungguh aku tak mampu
Telah kucoba untuk melupakanmu
Sulit bagiku, sungguh aku tak mampu"
Luka Hatiku,Papinka,"Lelah ku terdiam melihat kelakuan mu
Kau permainkan ku sesuka hati mu oh
Lelah hati ini menahan kepedihan ku
Apa kau merasa yang aku rasakan
Menangis ku saat mendengar kau dengannya
Terluka hati ku tersiksa batin ku oh
Teganya kau permainkan hati ku
Teganya kau buat ku menangis
Aku yang selalu mencintai mu
Sampai akhir hidup ku
Teganya kau permainkan hati ku
Teganya kau buat ku menangis
Aku akan pergi dari hidup mu
Walau sakit hati ku"
Kau Pilih Dia,Papinka,"Dalam hidupku
Rela untuk bertahan dengan dirimu
Sungguh terlalu kau sakiti diriku
Tinggalkan aku
Haruskah ku melupakan diri mu
Di dalam hidup ku
Namun aku tak akan pernah mampu
Ku mencintai mu
Mengertilah sesungguhnya
Bila kau memilih dia
Ku tak bisa ku tak rela
Ku pasti terluka
Karna dia yang kau cinta
Kini semua berbeda
Kau dan dia bahagia
Hati ku terluka
Tulus cintaku
Tak berarti bagi mu
Bodohnya aku"
Terlalu Cepat,Papinka,"Mengapa di dalam hatimu
Begitu mudah kau menduakanku?
Sedangkan di dalam hatiku
Begitu ku sangat mencintaimu
Mengapa kau setega itu?
Apa yang sebenarnya ada dalam hatimu?
Di manakah perasaanmu?
Sakit hatiku bila ingat kamu
Terlalu cepat untuk diriku
Terlalu sakit untuk melepasmu
Namun ku tak bisa lagi 'tuk bersama
Ku tak mau menjadi yang kedua
Terlalu cepat dalam hidupku
Bila kuharus kehilanganmu
Namun tak mengapa meskipun terluka
Asal saja kau merasa bahagia"
Seakan Hilang Ingatan,Papinka,"Mengapa harus melupakanmu
Padahal aku mencintaimu
Mengapa mudah perasaanmu
Mengganti aku di dalam hatimu
Apa yang kurang dari diriku
Sehingga kamu khianatiku
Seakan hilang ingatanmu
Percuma aku berikan cintaku
Andai saja kau tahu
Betapa 'ku mencintaimu
Dalamnya perasaanku
Tulus di dalam hatiku
Kuyakin pasti nanti kau akan tahu
Siapa yang terbaik untukmu
Ketika kau sadari itu
Terlambat sudah untukmu
'Ku sudah tak lagi mencintai kamu
Karena pasti ada yang baru
Mengisi di dalam hatiku
'Ku 'kan jadi kenangan hidupmu"
Cinta Tak Harus Miliki,Papinka,"Kini kau pergi meninggalkan aku
Hilanglah semua kebahagiaanku
Aku hanya bisa merelakan semua
Perpisahan ini berat bagiku
Kutahu cinta tak harus saling memiliki
Namun ku akan terus s'lalu menyayangimu
Walau kau kini bukan lagi jadi milikku
Aku 'kan s'lalu ada untuk dirimu
Kutahu cinta tak harus saling memiliki
Kubahagia bila melihat engkau tersenyum
Walau kau kini bukan lagi jadi milikku
Aku 'kan s'lalu ada untuk dirimu
Aku hanya bisa merelakan semua
Perpisahan ini berat bagiku
"
Aku yang Sayang,Papinka,"Aku yang mencintaimu
Mengapa kau sakiti aku
Apa selama ini ku tak baik untukmu
Aku yang sayang padamu
Mengapa kau melupakanku
Apa tak penting lagi ku di dalam hidupmu
Bila sampai semudah itu
Mampu kau patahkan hatiku
Apakah kau tau kubutuh waktu
Agar ku bisa melupakanmu
Dengan penuh penyesalanku
Mengapa dulu ku bisa mengenal dirimu
Bila akal secapat itu
Kau pergi meninggalkan aku
Dengan penuh luka hatiku
Disini ku hanya bisa lanjutkan hidupku
Hanya bisa berpura mampu
Bahagia tanpa ada kamu"
Rasa yang Hilang,Papinka,"Dan bila
Kini semua telah berubah
Jangan kau tanya-tanya oh mengapa
Aku tak berdaya
Dan apa yang kurasa
Oh rasa dalam jiwa
Sungguh tak bisa ku mengungkapkannya
Aku tak berdaya
Dan semua tentang dirimu
Dirimu yang dulu
Saat kau tinggalkan aku
Diriku menjauh
Saat terindah bersamamu
Saatku memilikimu
Terkubur dalam dihatiku
Kini ku harus tanpamu
Cinta yang hilang bersamamu
Cinta yang membebaniku
Telah kucoba Melepasmu
Kini ku harus tanpamu"
Dengan Caramu,Papinka,"Seribu cara telah kucoba
Untuk terus bersama
Namun tak pernah bisa
Keadaannya kau t'lah jauh berbeda
Sakit kurasa di depan mata
Melihat kau dengannya
Tiada pernah kusangka
Bila ternyata engkau membagi cinta
Dengan caramu aku merasa
Sungguh dirimu begitu tega
Tuhan yang tahu betapa sakitnya
Hati ini terluka
Mencintaimu ku tak berdaya
Bila dirimu mencintainya
Kini ku harus dapat menerima
Bila kau bahagia dengan dirinya
Uh-uh, dengan caramu aku merasa
Sungguh dirimu begitu tega
Tuhan yang tahu betapa sakitnya"
Siapa Dia,Papinka,"Saat pertama, ku melihat dirinya
Hatiku bertanya, tanya siapa si dia
Dag dug jantungku berdebar tak menentu
Diakah jodohku
Terus ku mencoba mendekati dirinya
Lalu ku bertanya siapakah namanya
Dia pun tersenyum, tersipu malu-malu
Berdebar jantungku
Sayang
Jantung ini berdebar, sayang
Berdegup tak karuan, sayang
Ku mau bilang
Bolehkah aku jadi kekasihmu
Bolehkah aku mencintai dirimu
Cintaku ini bukanlah cinta palsu
Jangan abaikan cintaku
Bolehkah aku jadi kekasihmu
Bolehkah aku mencintai dirimu
Karna dirimu yang terbaik untukku
Terima cintaku"
Kau,Papinka,"Kau selalu ada
Namun hadirmu
Hanya sesakkan dada
Kau buatku terluka
Kau hanya memandangku
Sebelah mata
Tak pernah kusangka
Secepat itu kau
Berpaling dengannya
Sakit hati jadinya
Ku hanya bisa coba
Lapangkan dada
Mungkin ku harus melepaskanmu
Mencoba melupakan dirimu
Mungkin tanpa ada
Kisah cinta kita
Hati ini tak lagi
Kan terluka
Maaf ku harus meninggalkanmu
Tak sanggup bila harus denganmu
Mungkin bila kita
Tak lagi bersama
Kau akan lebih merasa bahagia"
Sana Sini Rindu,Papinka,"Cinta ku cinta kepadamu
Cinta ku sangat sayang padamu
Bila ku mendapatkan dirimu
Cinta ku tak kan melepaskanmu
Sana sini aku rindu
Hanya kau pujaan hatiku
Ku disini selalu cinta
Disana cinta kamu
Jangan ragukan cintaku
Padamu pujaan hatiku
Ku pastikan selalu cinta
Hanya kepada kamu"
Berikan Aku Kesempatan,Papinka,"Sementara kau butuh
Aku tak pernah ada untukmu
Kuakui memang sudah
Sempat ku mengacuhkan dirimu
Sebenarnya tak ada niatku
Sedikit pun 'tuk melukaimu
Ku mengerti keadaanmu
Wajar sikapmu begitu
Maafkan aku yang t'lah melukaimu
Maafkanlah semua kesalahanku
Aku yang selalu
Membuat perih di dalam hatimu
Aku yang takut kehilangan cintamu
Kusadari semua kesalahanku
Bukalah hatimu
Berikan kesempatan 'tuk diriku"
Terasa Rindu,Papinka,"Dirimu
Selalu dalam hatiku
Terasa berat untukku
Mencoba melupakanmu
Selalu
Kusimpan dalam hatiku
Rasa cintaku padamu
Meski kau bukan untukku
Andai saja dirimu bahagia
Ku rela walau ku harus terluka
Karena kita tak mungkin lagi bersama
Bila kau mencintainya
Terasa rindu di hatiku
Mengapa kau pergi meninggalkanku
Andaikan kau tahu sesungguhnya aku
Masih selalu menyayangimu
Tuhan kuatkanlah diriku
Terlalu dalamnya luka hatiku
Semoga kau selalu bahagia hidupmu
Cintamu memang bukan untukku"
Pencuri Hati,Papinka,"Matamu melemahkan aku
Senyummu yang selalu sejukan hatiku
Dan buat aku terjatuh
Gayamu dan lembut suaramu
Membuatku semakin suka kepadamu
Tergila gila padamu
Rasanya aku
Tak sabar tuk miliki dirimu
Pastinya ku kan selalu
Berusaha semampu hatiku
Kamu pencuri hatiku
Aku tak boleh diam
Kau harus tahu
Bahwa ku suka padamu
Kamu pencuri hatiku
Aku tak boleh diam
Sebelum kamu
Pergi dan hilang dariku"
Bertahan,Papinka,"Ku takkan tangisi kisah cinta ini
Meski kau lukai perasaan ini
Ku akan selalu mencintaimu
Karena ku yakin tulus cinta ini
Tak akan terganti meski tak terbalas
Ku akan selalu ada untukmu
Apa pun yang terjadi
Ku terima semua sikapmu
Ku kan tetap bertahan denganmu
Apa pun yang engkau lakukan
Meski luka ku simpan di dalam hatiku
Akan tetap bertahan denganmu"
Cinta Setengah Hati,Papinka,"Entah sampai kapan lagi
Engkau mau mengerti
Harus berapa lama lagi
Ku lelah menanti
Kisah cinta kita ini
Sudah tak indah lagi
Tak seperti dulu lagi
Sudah setengah hati
Setiap kali kita sedang melewati hari
Slalu ku yang salah dimatamu
Aku tak ingin seperti ini
Ku ingin engkau tetap disini
Jangan terus kau begini
Terasa pilu dihati
Bila kau sudah tak cinta lagi
Sisakan cintamu dalam hati
Mungkin suatu hari nanti
Cintamu tak lagi setengah hati"
Tentang Dirimu,Papinka,"Ingin s'lalu memilikimu
Namun sungguh sulit untukku
Andai kau tahu perasaanku
Masih s'lalu menyayangimu
Coba katakan kepadaku
Salah dan kurangku padamu
Sungguh terlalu, keputusanmu
Kau pergi tinggalkan diriku
Tak pernah aku bayangkan
Kini kau t'lah milik orang
Sakit yang aku rasakan
Kucoba untuk bertahan
Tentang dirimu, tentang caramu
Kau perlakukan aku s'lalu sesuka hatimu
Andai kau tahu tentang perasaanku
Sungguh terluka hatiku"
Percuma,Papinka,"Ingin ku katakan pada dirimu
Tentang semua perasaanku
Agar kau tahu bahwa aku
Cinta kepadamu
Pertama kali saat berjumpa
Ku langsung jadi suka kepadanya
Namun tak bisa lagi
Ku mendapatkannya
Mau bilang cinta dan suka padanya
Mau bilang apa telah ada yang punya
Harus bagaimana ku menyatakannya
Percuma
Aku hanya bisa mencintai kamu
Kalau jodoh tak kemana"
Menangis,Papinka,"Sakit memang bila harus ku paksakan
Untuk bertahan namun kita tak sejalan
Untuk apa lagi diteruskan perjuangkan
Bila sudah tak nyaman
Mungkin memang sebaiknya kurelakan
Perpisahan dan coba untuk melupakan
Untuk apa lagi diteruskan perjuangkan
Ku bukan yang kau inginkan
Menangis bila hati ini mengingatmu
Ku tak menyangka kau telah permainkan aku
Ku berikan cinta kau membalas luka
Tak tau harus bagaimana
Ku hanya bisa menahan sakit hatiku
Sakit karena luka dikhianatimu
Aku bisa apa kau memilih dia
Aku kan mengalah"
Semua Tinggal Cerita,Papinka,"Kini usailah sudah
Cerita kisah cinta kita
Berakhir dengan luka saja
Kau anggap aku ini siapa
Semua tinggal cerita
Yang tak bisa dapat ku lupa
Saat-saat yang paling indah
Kini semua berganti luka
Bagaimana caranya
Agar hatiku bisa
Melupakan dirimu
Untuk selamanya
Ternyata di dalam hatimu
Tak pernah kau mencintaiku
Sakit bila ku ingat kamu
Terlalu pahit untukku
Mudahnya kau melupakanku
Terluka kau gores hatiku
Tak sanggup lagi ingat kamu
Tuhan tolong kuatkanlah hatiku"
Tak Mungkin Bersama,Papinka,"Sulitku coba menahan rasa
Luka dalam hatiku karenamu
Apa pernah kau
Pikirkan keadaanku

Saat kau pergi meninggalkanku
Sampai saat ini ku pun tak mampu
Tuk bisa dapat
Sembuhkan luka hatiku

Dulu begitu indah
Namun hilanglah sudah
Dan kini kau datang padaku
Dengan mudah berkata
Ingin mengulang semua

Kita tak mungkin untuk bersama
Sudah tak mungkin lagi maafkanlah
Ku bukanlah sebuah tempat tuk kau bisa
Bersandar saja saat kau terluka

Saat ini kau bisa berkata
Mencintaiku tapi maafkanlah
Sungguh ku tak bisa lagi tuk percaya
Lupakan saja sungguh ku tak bisa"
Sakit Karena Cintamu,Papinka,"Tiada lagi
Yang bisa dapat kuberi
Kurasa cukup sampai disini
Jalani semua ini
Tak sanggup lagi
Dengan pertengkaran ini
Kita sudah memang tak sehati
Jalani hubungan ini
Untuk apa lagi
Ku masih tetap disini
Bila semua ini
Kau cintai ku setengah hatiku
Biar ku pergi meninggalkanmu
Kurelakan dirimu
Sebelum hatiku terlalu
Sakit karena cintamu
Tak sanggup lagi diriku
Mencintai dirimu
Maafkan semua keputusaanku
Yang harus coba
Melupakanmu"
Untuk Perempuan Yang Sedang Dalam Peluka,Payung Teduh,"Tak terasa gelap pun jatuh
Diujung malam menuju pagi yang dingin
Hanya ada sedikit bintang malam ini
Mungkin karena kau sedang cantik-cantiknya
Lalu mataku merasa malu
Semakin dalam ia malu kali ini
Kadang juga ia takut
Tatkala harus berpapasan ditengah pelariannya
Di malam hari
Menuju pagi
Sedikit cemas
Banyak rindunya
Uuuu.
Uuuuuuuu...
Lalu mataku merasa malu
Semakin dalam ia malu kali ini
Kadang juga ia takut

Circles,Post Malone,"We couldn't turn around
'Til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now
But, no, I ain't too proud
I couldn't be there
Even when I tried
You don't believe it
We do this every time
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again
So I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away
Let go
I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I say so
I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
And I still hear the echoes (the echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

What you got to lose?
Make up your mind, tell me
What are you gonna do?

Cause I need to be saved, too
I'm no good at goodbyes
We're both acting insane, but too stubborn to change
Now I'm drinkin' again, 80 proof in my veins
And my fingertips stained, looking over the edge
Don't - with me tonight
Said you needed this heart then you got it
Turns out that it wasn't what you wanted
And we wouldn't let go and we lost it
Now I'm a goner
I want you out of my head
I want you out of my bedroom tonight
There's no way I could save you
Cause I need to be saved, too
I'm no good at goodbyes
I want you right in my life
I want you back here tonight

I wanna slice you and dice you
My argues possessive, it got you precise
Can you not turn off the TV? I'm watching the fight
I flood the garage, blue diamond, no shark
You're Barbie life doll, it's Nicki Minaj
You don't need a key to drive, your car on the charger

But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
Settle down, I spell it out, it's simple enough
I came around, I figured out, should follow my gut
I don't play anymore, I went through your phone
And caught the girls in your DM's and took all them home
And I know it's been a while since the last time you heard from me
Grew into a savage and that's why they gave this verse to me
Turns out at shows 'cause they turn out at shows
I sold 15 million copies of a break-up note
Brought some strangers in our beds
And now you lost your right to privacy
Spilling all our secrets
When you thought they'd probably die with me
Know you fucking love it on the low
And you don't have to say I'm crazy
'Cause I know nothing's changed
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see (but you lied, you lied, you lied)

It's too late to turn this - around (it's too late)
So don't try and tell me that you're happy for me now
Used to have friends now I got enemies
Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me
Money tend to show all their tendencies
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad
Sometimes, every time, they let me down
Sometimes, every time, they let me down
Used to have friends now I got enemies
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad
Ooh, it's too late
It's too late"
Waiting For Never,Post Malone,"Should've seen the signs, so I guess I deserved it
Made a habit overlookin' cracks in the surface
Goin' along with the bullshit you sold me
What was I to do when the bottle stopped workin'?
Tryna make a home out a house while it's burnin' down
Burnin' to the ground
Oh, if all these walls could talk
They would tell me, ""Sit down, man, shut the fuck up""
You put me through hell but I can't get enough
It took a lil' while, baby, then I woke up
Whoa, when all these tattoos fade
I will never look back, you'll be in the same place
I keep tellin' myself, if I wanted you to change
I'd be waiting for never
Waiting for never
Yeah, you could've done a better job at hidin' your intentions
I know what you did, stop bein' so defensive
Save it, when did you become so jaded?
I seen so many come and go, then come back to me
I'll never ever let another take half of me
I can't win, and still I chase it
Oh, if all these walls could talk
They would tell me, ""Sit down, man, shut the fuck up""
You put me through hell but I can't get enough
It took a lil' while, baby, then I woke up
Whoa, when all these tattoos fade
I will never look back, you'll be in the same place
I keep tellin' myself, if I wanted you to change
I'd be waiting for never
Waiting for never
Just look right at my face
Yeah, you should stay away
There's nothin' left to fake
There's nothin' left to take
Oh, if all these walls could talk
They would tell me, ""Sit down, man, shut the fuck up""
You put me through hell but I can't get enough
It took a lil' while, baby, then I woke up
Whoa, when all these tattoos fade
I will never look back, you'll be in the same place
I keep tellin' myself, if I wanted you to change
I'd be waiting for never
Waiting for never"
Lemon Tree,Post Malone,"Couldn't fall asleep all night
I tried with all my might
I thought I knew what you want
It isn't all that nice
But I guess it will suffice
It's hard to know what you want
Could you be?
A little less sour, we're rotting by the hour
And my heart's rotten too
In every film I watch, I'm on the side of the bad guy
So turn around and show me that I'm better
Some people got an apple
Some people got a tangerine
Looking around and all I see is people happy with what they're given
Life is pretty sweet, I'm told
I guess I'm just shit outta luck growing a lemon tree
I'm gonna burn it down
And grow me something better, hey-yeah
Blood on my hands, I'm on the fence, I double down
A swing and a miss, a kick in the ribs, in trouble now
Came from the dirt, back in the ground, when I die
But I'ma survive, I got my ways, oh
Could you be?
A little less sour, we're rotting by the hour
And my heart's rotten too
In every film I watch, I'm on the side of the bad guy
So turn around and show me that I'm better
Some people got an apple
Some people got a tangerine
Looking around and all I see is people happy with what they're given
Life is pretty sweet, I'm told
I guess I'm just shit outta luck growing a lemon tree
I'm gonna burn it down
And grow me something better, hey-yeah"
Sunflower,Post Malone,"Eh, eh, eh, eh (Ooh)
Uh, uh, uh, uh (Uh)
Eh, eh
Uh uh, some things you just can't refuse
She wanna ride me like a cruise and I'm not tryna lose
Then you're left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're a sunflower, I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower
Yo no sé lo que tú tienes
Cómo hace' lo que quiera' con mi vida, tú te vas y luego vienes
Yo no sé qué tiene' tú, pero a la ve' yo pienso que no me convienes
A veces trato de buscar una salida, rápido tú me detienes
Así de loco tú me quieres
Pero soy un loco por ti
Tú no sabe' lo que por dentro yo siento por ti
Y por má' que no quiero verte, vuelvo a repetir
Y sentir cada parte de tu cuerpo cuando estas aquí
No te puedo mentir
Siempre estoy buscándote, yeah-yey
Trato de alejarme y tú acercándote, yeah-yey
De lo que nos pasa siempre culpándote, yeah-yey
Pero se me olvida cuando te veo desnudándote
Y no sé por qué
And you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower
Ese día que te conocí
No sabía que iba a ser así
El girasol más lindo del jardín
Y verte en el amanecer
Con un beso volví a caer
Dime a dónde se fue, a dónde se fue
Y ahora me quedo con la confusión
Con sentimientos de amor y dolor
Te juro que esa no fue mi intención
La flor de antes cambió de color
Uh-uh-uh-uuh
En mi vida solo existes tú
Baby, tell what we trynna prove
Si tú sabes que yo soy tu luz (Si tú sabes que yo soy tu luz)
And you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, es que tu amor es just too much
Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower"
Merengku Mesra,Putra Timur,"Pagi yang cerah, berbisik nada indah
Semerbak wangi bunga membuai helai pelita
Asmara asa mencinta
Kita berdua memadu khayal jiwa
Dan bila badai kelak menerjang
Mendekatlah, sayang, kau 'kan tenang
Dan kita 'kan bersama merengkuh mesra damai jiwa
Menebar di seluruh cakrawala
Dan nada-nada sukacita melantunkan bahagia
Walau badai menerjang
Mendekatlah sayang, kau 'kan tenang
Dan kita 'kan bersama merengkuh mesra damai jiwa
Menebar di seluruh cakrawala
Dan nada-nada sukacita melantunkan bahagia
Dua insan bercinta menghangatkan dinginnya malam
Serasa bunga hati memekar
Hingga pagi datang, 'ku terjaga di antara pelukan"
Cinta Sampai Mati,"Raffa Affar
","Duhai engkau sang belahan jiwa
Namamu terukir dalam pusara
Di setiap langkah ku selalu berdoa
Semoga kita bersama

Duhai engkau tambatan hatiku
Labuhkanlah cintamu di hidupku
Kuingin kau tahu betapa merindu
Hiduplah engkau denganku

Dengarkanlah
Di sepanjang malam aku berdoa
Bersujud dan lalu aku meminta
Semoga kita bersama

Di sepanjang malam aku berdoa
Cintaku untukmu selalu terjaga
Dan aku pasti setia"
Jatuh Hati,Raisa,"Ada ruang hatiku yang kau temukan
Sempat aku lupakan kini kau sentuh
Aku bukan jatuh cinta
Namun aku jatuh hati
Ku terpikat pada tuturmu
Aku tersihir jiwamu
Terkagum pada pandangmu
Caramu melihat dunia
Kuharap kau tahu bahwa ku
Terinspirasi hatimu
Ku tak harus memilikimu
Tapi bolehkah ku selalu di dekatmu
Ada ruang hatiku kini kau sentuh
Aku bukan jatuh cinta
Namun aku jatuh hati
Katanya cinta
Memang banyak bentuknya
Ku tahu pasti
Sungguh aku jatuh hati"
Could it be,Raisa,"Kau datang dan jantungku berdegup kencang
Kau buatku terbang melayang
Tiada ku sangka getaran ini ada
Saat jumpa yang pertama
Mataku tak dapat terlepas darimu
Perhatikan setiap tingkahmu
Tertawa pada setiap candamu
Saat jumpa yang pertama"
Tentang Cinta,Raisa,"Cinta, apalah rasa hidup tanpa hadirnya
Tetes keringat tanpa makna
Waktu hanya akan berlalu tanpa warna
Cinta, tak pernah benar-benar kita pahami
Cinta, penuhi harimu dan penuhi waktumu
Cinta, aliri darahmu, aliri jiwamu
Cinta, apalah rasa hidup tanpa hadirnya
Diriku, hatiku, penuhi tutur dengan cinta
Darahku, jiwaku, aliri selalu dengan cinta
Sejauh ku bisa"
Ragu,Raisa,"Hangatnya senyummu
Harusnya tak ku abaikan
Oh hatiku rasakan cintamu
Namun tak menggebu-gebu
Ini ragaku memang hatiku yang ku janjikan
Namun rasaku dan pikiranku bukan padamu hei yeah
Alangkah mudahnya bila kau pilih aku
Andai ku bisa berikan yang kau pinta
Takkan bercela dalamnya cintaku
Jujur ku tak sanggup
Akui hanyalah lemahnya hati ini
Yang buatku tak mampu lepaskan
Ingin kau tetap di sini
Hangatnya senyummu
Harusnya tak ku lewatkan
Namun rasaku dan pikiranku bukan padamu hm
Alangkah mudahnya bila kau pilih aku hm
Andai ku bisa berikan yang kau pinta
Takkan bercela dalamnya cintaku
Jujur ku tak sanggup
Akui hanyalah lemahnya hati ini
Yang buatku tak mampu lepaskan
Ingin kau tetap di sini
Penuh ragu namun ku jalani oh (sampai kapan)
Oh akan begini cinta tak mungkin ku paksakan
Andai ku bisa berikan yang kau pinta
Takkan bercela dalamnya cintaku jujur oh
Akui hanyalah lemahnya hati ini
Yang buatku tak mampu lepaskan
Ingin kau tetap di sini yeah hm
Ey yeah
Ha ah hm"
Cinta Sederhana,Raisa,"Biarkan ku mempelajarimu
Biar kutahu cara mendengarkanmu
Biarkan kutawarkan pelukan
Saat kau tak butuh kata-kata
Tenang tenanglah
Tak slalu berbunga-bunga
Namun kupastikan ada
Cintaku yang sederhana
Tak perlu mengada-ada ha hm
Kan kujaga rahasiamu
Takkan ada satu jiwa pun yang tahu
Biarlah aku yang jadi perisai
Tajamnya panah-panah mereka
Tenang tenanglah
Tak slalu berbunga-bunga
Namun kupastikan ada
Cintaku yang sederhana
Tak perlu mengada-ada uh
Biarkan ku yang mempercayaimu (mempercayaimu)
Saat dunia ragukan perasaanmu
Takkan ada yang sulit bagiku (bagiku)
Selama kita jalani bersama
Tenang tenanglah
Tenang tenanglah"
Kau RumahKU,Raisa,"Bagaikan sungai yang tak punya malu
Mengalir meskipun terancam surut
Lalu (hmm), kakimu melangkah ke rumahku
Setengah melirik, mencoba rayu
Apa yang kau inginkan
Dari senyumku, ya tuan?
Gemar sekali kau lukiskan bintang untukku
Sungguh lihai tanganmu menata kembali hati
Yang hampir mati
'Kan ku letakkan hangat di tengah dekap kita
Jangan biarkan ku pulang
Ke rumah yang bukan engkau
Bicarakan tentang seisi dunia
Perlahan mendekat, bisikkan cinta
Membuatku terlena
Ke dalam pesona sukma yang begitu indah
Apa yang kau inginkan
Dari senyumku, ya tuan?
Ohh
Gemar sekali kau lukiskan bintang untukku
Sungguh lihai tanganmu menata kembali hati
Yang hampir mati
'Kan ku letakkan hangat di tengah dekap kita
Jangan biarkan ku pulang
Ke rumah yang bukan engkau
Jika mampu ku menjelajahi langit
'Kan ku petik pelangi 'tuk warnai harimu
Jangan khawatir, masih ada aku
Jangan khawatir, masih ada aku
Gemas sekali kau lukiskan bintang untukku
Sungguh lihai tanganmu menata kembali hati
Yang hampir mati
'Kan ku letakkan hangat di tengah dekap kita
'Kan aku persilahkan kau menetap di sini"
Usai di Sini,Raisa,"Pedihnya tanya yang tak terjawab
Mampu menjatuhkanku yang dikira tegar
Kau tepikan aku kau renggut mimpi
Yang dulu kita ukir bersama
Seolah aku tak pernah jadi bagian besar dalam hari-harimu
Lebih baik kita usai di sini
Sebelum cerita indah tergantikan pahitnya sakit hati
Bukannya aku mudah menyerah tapi bijaksana
Mengerti kapan harus berhenti
Ku kan menunggu tapi tak selamanya
Kau tepikan aku kau renggut mimpi
Yang dulu kita ukir bersama
Seolah aku tak pernah jadi bagian besar dalam hari-harimu
Seolah janji dan kata-kata yang telah terucap kehilangan arti
Lebih baik kita usai di sini
Sebelum cerita indah tergantikan pahitnya sakit hati
Bukannya aku mudah menyerah tapi bijaksana
Mengerti kapan harus berhenti
Ku kan menunggu tapi tak selamanya
Tak akan jera kupercaya cinta
Manis dan pahitnya kan kuterima
Kini kisah kita akhiri dengan makna
Lebih baik kita usai di sini
Sebelum cerita indah tergantikan pahitnya sakit hati
Bukannya aku mudah menyerah tapi bijaksana
Mengerti kapan harus berhenti
Ku kan menunggu tapi tak selamanya
Ku kan menanti
Tapi tak selamanya"
Biarkanlah,Raisa,"Berakhirlah, terpaksa mengingat
Akhir dari, cerita sempurna
Yang kita coba pertahankan
Namun berujung jua
Benar atau salah
Kini tiada berarti, biarkanlah
Sekuat tenaga
Ku harus melepasnya
Waktu terus akan berlalu
Tanpa mungkin, Ia menunggu
Seberat apa pun hatimu
Akan berujung jua
Benar atau salah
Kini tiada berarti, biarkanlah

Sekuat tenaga
Ku harus melepasnya
Tiada pemenang
Kau dan aku hanya bisa bertahan
Sekuat tenaga, kau harus melepasnya
Relakan semua yang telah berakhir
Takkan berubah yang pernah terukir
Walau air mata mengalir

Benar atau salah
Kini tiada berarti, biarkanlah
Sekuat tenaga
Ku harus melepasnya
Tiada pemenang
Kau dan aku hanya bisa bertahan
Sekuat tenaga, kau harus melepasnya
Seberat apa pun hatimu
Akan berujung jua"
Bersinar,Raisa,"Saat kau merasa tak bercahaya
Seakan semua kegelapan menyelimuti harimu
Dan kau merasa takkan pernah usai
Buang saja gundah di hatimu
Biarkan berlalu, ini bukan akhir dunia
Tersenyumlah, percayalah
Bebaskan dirimu, bersinarlah ooh
Lepaskanlah keraguanmu
Bukalah hatimu, bersinarlah
Kegelapan menyelimuti harimu
Dan kau merasa takkan pernah usai
Buang saja gundah di hatimu
Biarkan berlalu, ini bukan akhir dunia
Tersenyumlah, percayalah
Bebaskan dirimu, bersinarlah ooh
Lepaskanlah keraguanmu
Bukalah hatimu, bersinarlah
Pancarkanlah cahaya
Hapus air mata
(Pancarkan) cahaya dirimu
(Bersinarlah) bersinarlah
Tersenyumlah, percayalah
Bebaskan dirimu, bersinarlah ooh
percayalah
Bebaskan dirimu, bersinarlah ooh
Lepaskanlah keraguanmu
Bukalah hatimu, bersinarlah

Pemeran Utama,Raisa,"Ya aku mengerti betapa sulit untuk kembali
Dan mempercayai penipu ini sekali lagi
Pemeran utama hati
Pemicu detak jantung ini
Baru kini kusadari
Setelah berlayar pergi
Itu kamu
Ya aku wanita
Yang seharusnya lebih perasa
Tapi malah aku mencabik
Lukai kau yang baik
Dan buat hatimu sakit
Meski malu untuk akui
Aku mau
Kau kembali
Pemeran utama hati
Pemicu detak jantung ini
Baru kini ku sadari
Setelah berlayar pergi
Pemicu detak jantung ini
Baru kini ku sadari
Setelah berlayar pergi itu kamu"
Teka-teki,Raisa,"Dirimu buatku selalu penasaran
Terkadang menjauh terkadang buatku tersipu
Malu manisnya ucapanmu
Membuatku tak menentu
Ku tak tahu harus bagaimana
Sungguh kau buatku bertanya-tanya
Dengan teka-teki teka-tekimu
Mungkinkah ku temukan jawaban
Teka-teki teka-tekimu
Sadarkah dirimu akan apa yang ku rasa
Haruskah diriku menyatakan yang sesungguhnya
Malu manisnya ucapanmu
Membuatku tak menentu
Ku tak tahu bagaimana
Sungguh kau buatku bertanya-tanya
Dengan teka-teki teka-tekimu
Mungkinkah ku temukan jawaban
Teka-teki teka-tekimu
Sungguh kau buatku bertanya-tanya
Dengan teka-teki teka-tekimu
Mungkinkah ku temukan jawaban
Teka-teki teka-tekimu
Terkadang ku merasa hampir tak mampu
Menghadapi kamu dan semua tanda tanyamu
Sungguh kau buatku bertanya-tanya
Dengan teka-teki teka-teki teka-tekimu
Mungkinkah ku temukan jawaban
Teka-teki teka-tekimu
Sungguh kau buatku bertanya-tanya
Dengan teka-teki teka-tekimu
Mungkinkah ku temukan jawaban
Teka-teki teka-tekimu
Engkau buatku bertanya-tanya
Dengan semua teka-teki teka-tekimu
Mungkinkah ku temukan jawaban
Teka-teki teka-tekimu"

Terjebak Nostalgia,Raisa,"Telah lama ku tahu engkau
Punya rasa untukku
Kini saat dia tak kembali
Kau nyatakan cintamu

Namun aku takkan pernah bisa

Ku Takkan pernah merasa
Rasakan cinta yang kau beri
Ku terjebak di ruang nostalgia
Semua yang ku rasa kini
Tak berubah sejak dia pergi
Maafkanlah ku hanya ingin sendiri 
Ku di sini

Namun aku takkan pernah bisa, ku

Inginku,Raisa,"Tak ku percaya
Tak ku duga
Semua datang begitu saja
Ku pun bertanya
Dalam dada
Benarkah rasa itu ada

Tak perlu ku menunggu
Lama untuk kepastian itu

Oh ingin ku bicara semua rasa
Ada cinta antara kita berdua
Yakin ada kesempatan untuk
Jalani indahnya darinya

Tak perlu ku menunggu
Lama untuk kepastian itu

Oh ingin ku bicara semua rasa
Ada cinta antara kita berdua
Yakin ada kesempatan untuk
Jalani indah darinya

Telah ku rangkai kata-kata
Untuk nyatakan
Oh dengarkan kasihku
Ku ingin kau tahu
Isi hatiku

Oh ingin ku bicara semua rasa
Ada cinta antara kita berdua
Yakin ada kesempatan untuk
Jalani indah darinya

Oh ingin ku bicara semua rasa
Ada cinta antara kita berdua
Yakin ada kesempatan untuk
Jalani indah darinya
"
Katakan!,Raisa,"Hey
Oh
Yeah
Ada rasa yang terus mengganggu hatiku
Sulit untuk meyakini ucapanmu
Apa ku harus tetap bertahan
Katakan katakan
Kau tak menyimpan rasa kepadanya
Buktikan buktikan paksa ku percaya
Hey yeah
Cukup bagiku kau tak perlu jelaskan lagi
Aku telah mendengar semua alasanmu
Dia hanya teman kau bilang dia bukan siapa-siapa
Katakan katakan
Kau tak menyimpan rasa kepadanya

LDR,Raisa,"Hallo
Aku kangen
Ku teringat dalam lamunan
Rasa sentuhan jemari tanganmu
Ku teringat walau telah pudar
Suara tawamu, sungguh ku rindu
Tanpamu langit tak berbintang
Tanpamu hampa yang ku rasa
Seandainya jarak tiada berarti
Akan ku arungi ruang dan waktu dalam sekejap saja
Seandainya sang waktu dapat mengerti
Takkan ada rindu yang terus mengganggu
Kau akan kembali bersamaku
Ku teringat walau telah pudar
Suara tawamu, sungguh ku rindu
Tanpamu langit tak berbintang
Tanpamu hampa yang ku rasa
Seandainya jarak tiada berarti
Akan ku arungi ruang dan waktu dalam sekejap saja
Seandainya sang waktu dapat mengerti
Takkan ada rindu yang terus mengganggu
Kau akan kembali bersamaku
Terbit dan tenggelamnya mentari
Membawamu lebih dekat
Denganmu langitku berbintang
Denganmu sempurna ku rasa
Seandainya jarak tiada berarti
Akan ku arungi ruang dan waktu dalam sekejap saja
Seandainya sang waktu dapat mengerti
Takkan ada rindu yang terus mengganggu
Kau akan kembali bersamaku
(Seandainya jarak tiada berarti)
Akan ku arungi ruang dan waktu dalam sekejap saja
Seandainya sang waktu dapat mengerti
Takkan ada rindu yang terus mengganggu
Kau akan kembali bersamaku"
Pandangan Pertama,Ran,"lama ku memendam rasa di dada
Mengagumi indahmu, wahai jelita
Tak dapat lagi kuucap kata
Bisuku diam terpesona
Hodan andai suatu hari kau jadi milikku
Tak akan kulepas dirimu, kasih
Dan bila waktu mengizinkanku untuk menunggu
Kurasa ku telah jatuh cinta
Pada pandangan yang pertama
Sulit bagiku untuk bisa
Berhenti mengagumi dirinya
Seiring dengan berjalannya waktu
Akhirnya kita berdua bertemu
Diriku tersipu malu
Melihat sikapmu yang lucu"
Dekat Dihati,Ran,"Dering telefonku membuatku tersenyum di pagi hari
Kau bercerita semalam kita bertemu dalam mimpi
Entah mengapa aku merasakan hadirmu di sini
Tawa candamu menghibur saatku sendiri
Aku di sini dan kau di sana
Hanya berjumpa via suara
Namun ku slalu menunggu saat kita akan berjumpa
Meski kau kini jauh di sana
Kita memandang langit yang sama
Jauh di mata namun dekat di hati
Dering telefonku membuatku tersenyum di pagi hari
Tawa candamu menghibur saatku sendiri
Aku di sini dan kau di sana
Hanya berjumpa via suara
Namun ku slalu menunggu saat kita akan berjumpa
Meski kau kini jauh di sana
Kita memandang langit yang sama
Jauh di mata namun dekat di hati
Aku di sini dan kau di sana
Hanya berjumpa via suara
Namun ku slalu menunggu saat kita akan berjumpa
Meski kau kini jauh di sana
Kita memandang langit yang sama
Jauh di mata namun kau dekat di hati
Jarak dan waktu takkan berarti
Karena kau akan selalu di hati
Bagai detak jantung yang kubawa kemanapun kupergi
Meski kau kini jauh di sana
Kita memandang langit yang sama
Jauh di mata namun dekat di hati
Dekat di hati
Dekat di hati"
Pergi Hilang Dan Lupakan,Remember of Today,"Dunia hari ini begitu tak berarti
Tak berjalan cepat seolah tak peduli
Lambat laun ku bertahan dengan hari ini
Hari yang takkan pernah berakhir
Semua telah berubah sejalan dengan waktu
Setiap detik berharga bagiku
Waktu pun ingin kuubah
Tuk kembali tertawa
Aku hanya bisa menangis
Aku tak bisa
Maafkanlah diriku
Atas semua kesalahan yang kuperbuat
Selama ini kepada dirimu
Aku berjanji akan melepasmu
Dengan senyuman yang akan kau ingat
Dan kau kenang sampai mati
Selamanya
Lupakanlah semua kenangan ini
Hancurkanlah semua mimpi-mimpi
Jangan pernah kembali
Dan takkan pernah kembali
Dan janganlah kau pernah berikan aku satu harapan
Dan karena ku ingin
Pergi hilang dan lupakan
Maafkanlah diriku
Atas semua kesalahan yang kuperbuat
Selama ini kepada dirimu
Dan berjanji akan melepasmu
Dengan senyuman yang akan kau ingat
Dan kau kenang sampai mati
Selamanya"
Aku Tetap Cinta,Repvblik,"Tak perlu kata maaf dan air mata
Aku rela dirimu pergi
Aku bisa tau apa yang kau mau
Dengan pilihanmu
Hancur-hancur cintaku sakit-sakit hatiku
Tapi tak bisa aku menyalahkanmu
Inilah jalanmu inilah nasibku yang tak kusuka
Asal kau tahu seumur hidupku aku tetap cinta
Tak perlu kata maaf dan air mata
Aku rela dirimu pergi
Aku bisa tau apa yang kau mau
Dengan pilihanmu
Hancur-hancur cintaku sakit-sakit hatiku
Tapi tak bisa aku menyalahkanmu
Inilah jalanmu inilah nasibku yang tak kusuka
Asal kau tahu seumur hidupku aku tetap cinta
Hancur-hancur cintaku sakit-sakit hatiku

Sandiwara CInta,Repvblik,"Aku tahu ini semua tak adil
Aku tahu ini sudah terjadi
Mau bilang apa aku pun tak sanggup
Air matamu tak lagi mau menetes
Alasannya sering kali kudengar
Alasannya sering kali kau ucap
Kau dengannya seakan ku tak tahu
Sandiwara apa yang telah kau lakukan
Kepadaku
Jujurlah sayang aku tak mengapa
Biar semua jelas tak berbeda
Jika nanti aku yang harus pergi
Kuterima walau sakit hati
Mungkin ini jalan yang engkau mau
Mungkin ini jalan yang kau inginkan
Kau dengannya seakan ku tak tahu
Sandiwara apa
Ceritanya apa
Aku tahu
Jujurlah sayang aku tak mengapa
Biar semua jelas tak berbeda
Jika nanti aku yang harus pergi
Kuterima walau sakit hati
Jujurlah sayang aku tak mengapa
Biar semua jelas tak berbeda
Jika nanti aku yang harus pergi
Kuterima walau sakit hati
Kuterima walau sakit hati"
Aku Takut,Repvblik,"Katamu, cintaku berlebihan
Cemburuku tak beralasan
Membuat dirimu tak nyaman
Maafkan aku, sayang
Aku takut kehilangan dirimu
Aku takut, takut kehilanganmu
Aku takut kehilangan cintamu
Aku takut hidup tanpa dirimu
Aku tak akan bisa
Aku yang bisa gila
Bila kau pergi meninggalkanku
Ho-oh-uh
Katamu, cintaku berlebihan
Cemburuku tak beralasan
Bagaikan burung dalam sangkar
Maafkan aku, sayang
Aku takut kehilangan dirimu
Aku takut, takut kehilanganmu
Aku takut kehilangan cintamu
Aku takut hidup tanpa dirimu
Aku tak akan bisa
Aku yang bisa gila
Bila kau pergi meninggalkanku
Ho-wo-oh
Aku takut kehilangan dirimu

Aku takut hidup tanpa dirimu
Aku tak akan bisa
Aku yang bisa gila
Bila kau pergi meninggalkanku"
Selimut Tetangga,Repvblik,"Bersabarlah, Sayang, aku akan pulang
Jangan dengarkan gosip murahan tentang aku
Berjanjilah, Sayang, 'tuk s'lalu setia
Meski ku tak s'lalu di sampingmu
Tak usah menangis, meratapi aku
Tak perlu kau berfikir ku meninggalkanmu
Mana mungkin selimut tetangga
Hangati tubuhku dalam kedinginan
Malam-malam panjang, setiap tidurku
S'lalu kesepian
Mana mungkin selimut tetangga
Hangati tubuhku dalam kedinginan
Malam-malam panjang, setiap tidurku
S'lalu kesepian
Berjanjilah, Sayang, 'tuk s'lalu setia
Meski ku tak s'lalu di sampingmu
Tak usah menangis, meratapi aku
Tak perlu kau berfikir ku meninggalkanmu, wo-wo-oh
Tak usah menangis, meratapi aku
Tak perlu kau berfikir ku meninggalkanmu
Mana mungkin selimut tetangga
Hangati tubuhku dalam kedinginan
Malam-malam panjang, setiap tidurku
S'lalu kesepian, ho-oh
Mana mungkin selimut tetangga
Hangati tubuhku dalam kedinginan
Malam-malam panjang, setiap tidurku
S'lalu kesepian
Bersabarlah, Sayang, aku akan pulang"
Hanya Ingin Kau Tahu,Repvblik,"Ku telah miliki
Rasa indahnya perihku
Rasa hancurnya harapku
Kau lepas cintaku
Rasakan abadi
Sekalipun kau mengerti
Sekalipun kau pahami
Ku pikir ku salah mengertimu
Hoo woo aku hanya ingin kau tahu
Besarnya cintaku
Tingginya khayalku bersamamu
Tuk lalui waktu yang tersisa kini
Di setiap hariku
Di sisa akhir nafas hidupku
Walaupun semua hanya ada dalam mimpiku
Hanya ada dalam anganku
Melewati hidup
Rasakan abadi
Sekalipun kau mengerti
Sekalipun kau pahami
Ku pikir ku salah mengertimu
Hoo woo aku hanya ingin kau tahu
Besarnya cintaku
Tingginya khayalku bersamamu
Tuk lalui waktu yang tersisa kini
Di setiap hariku
Di sisa akhir nafas hidupku
Hoo woo aku hanya ingin kau tahu
Besarnya cintaku
Tingginya khayalku bersamamu
Tuk lalui waktu yang tersisa kini
Di setiap hariku
Di sisa akhir nafas hidupku"
Sayang Sampai Mati,Repvblik,"Belah dada ini, lihatlah hatiku
Bila itu bisa yakinkanmu
Hidup dan matiku hanya untuk cintaku
Hati takkan bisa dusta
Aku sayang sampai mati segenap hati ini
Rasaku membahana, getarkan jiwa
Aku sayang sampai mati segenap jiwa ini
Biarlah kubuktikan janji hatiku
Belah dada ini, lihatlah hatiku
Bila itu bisa yakinkanmu
Hidup dan matiku hanya untuk cintaku
Hati takkan bisa dusta
Oh Aku sayang sampai mati segenap hati ini
Rasaku membahana, getarkan jiwa
Aku sayang sampai mati segenap jiwa ini
Biarlah kubuktikan janji hatiku
Oh Aku sayang sampai mati segenap hati ini
Rasaku membahana, getarkan jiwa
Aku sayang, sayang, sayang sampai mati
Biarlah kubuktikan janji hatiku
Aku sayang, sayang sampai mati"
Telah Kuberikan,Repvblik,"Andaikan dulu 'ku tak pernah mencintaimu
Mungkin semua 'kan berbeda
Takkan pernah terjadi kisah kita
Andaikan dulu kau tak pernah mencintaiku
Mungkin semua 'kan berbeda
Takkan pernah 'ku rasakan luka
'Ku biarkan semua yang telah terjadi, biarlah, biarlah
'Ku sadari semua bahwa memang cintamu bukan untukku
Telah 'ku berikan cintaku, telah 'ku berikan sayangku

Tiada Guna Lagi,Repvblik,"Tiada guna lagi mengharapmu untuk kumiliki
Takkan ada lagi kesempatanku tuk kembali
Gemuruh cintaku segenggam maafku
Takkan mungkin bisa menggantikan salahku
Bagaimana lagi bila itu yang harus terjadi
Dengan besar hati kan ku terima semua ini
Kau buat diriku terbunuh cintamu
Apalah dayaku ini memang salahku
Oh akankah terulang kembali
Masa masa kita yang dulu ada
Oh ku akui memang ku salah
Tak berada di dekatmu di saat kau rindu
Bagaimana lagi bila itu yang harus terjadi
Dengan besar hati kan ku terima semua ini
Kau buat diriku terbunuh cintamu

Tak berada di dekatmu di saat kau rindu ho
Oh akankah terulang kembali
Masa masa kita yang dulu ada
Oh ku akui memang ku salah
Tak berada di dekatmu di saat kau rindu"
Aku Bukan Dirimu,Repvblik,"Sekian lama Aku mencoba melupakan dirimu
Terlalu kuat dirimu bersama di hatiku
Kau lupai aku sedalam ini
Tinggalkan waktu lupakan dirimu melanjutkan hidupku
Semakin aku mencoba
Semakin aku terluka
Semakin aku terbenam cinta
Aku bukan dirimu yang mudah melupakan segalanya
Yang mudah menghilangkan semuanya
Tersiksa hatiku
Aku bukan dirimu yang mudah mengakhiri semuanya
Yang mudah menghilangkan semuanya
Tersiksa hatiku
Aku bukan dirimu yang mudah melupakan segalanya
Yang muda menghilangkan semua kenangan
Tersiksa hatiku
Aku bukan dirimu yang mudah melupakan segalanya
Yang mudah menghilangkan semuanya
Tersiksa hatiku
Tersiksa hatiku"
Aku dan Perasaan Ini,Repvblik,"Berulangkali ku yakinkan cinta ini
Kepadamu yang ku puja selama ini
Namun terus kau menghancurkan diriku
Cintaku jiwaku
Andai kau tau cara yang telah ku tempuh
Demi mendapatkan utuhnya hatimu
Sampai sampai ku pertaruhkan diriku
Cintaku jiwaku
Semoga kau mengerti
Aku dan perasaan ini
Harusnya kau sadari
Betapa besar cintaku ini
Andai kau tau cara yang telah ku tempuh
Demi mendapatkan utuhnya hatimu
Sampai sampai ku pertaruhkan diriku
Cintaku jiwaku
Semoga kau mengerti
Aku dan perasaan ini
Harusnya kau sadari
Betapa besar cintaku ini"
Ingkar Janji,Repvblik,"Terakhir kali kau temui diriku
Kau ucapkan janji akan kembali
Waktu terus berlalu, ku menunggu
Kabar yang tak pasti
Bila kau tak cinta, katakan saja
Aku rela lepaskan cintamu
Seperih apa pun, sesakit apa pun
Biarlah aku saja yang rasakan
Cintaku tak pernah kau balaskan
Perihku tak pernah kuucapkan
Seperih apa pun, sesakit apa pun
Ku rela asalkan kau bahagia
Ternyata akhir dari semua ini
Kau ingkari janji-janji manismu
Waktu terus berlalu, ku menunggu
Kabar yang tak pasti, oh-oh
Bila kau tak cinta, katakan saja
Aku rela lepaskan cintamu
Seperih apa pun, sesakit apa pun
Biarlah aku saja yang rasakan
Cintaku tak pernah kau balaskan
Perihku tak pernah kuucapkan
Seperih apa pun, sesakit apa pun
Ku rela asalkan kau bahagia
Bila kau tak cinta, katakan saja
Aku rela lepaskan cintamu
Seperih apa pun, sesakit apa pun
Biarlah aku saja yang rasakan
Cintaku tak pernah kau balaskan
Perihku tak pernah kuucapkan
Seperih apa pun, sesakit apa pun
Ku rela asalkan kau bahagia
Seperih apa pun, sesakit apa pun
Ku rela asalkan kau bahagia
"
Sakit Aku Sakit,Repvblik,"Sejenak aku merenungi
Sehingga aku menyesali
Mengapa engkau mengingkari
Kau buat aku patah hati
Seandainya aku bisa
Kembalikan waktu
Tapi itu takkan bisa
Jika ku ulang kembali
Sakit aku sakit
Kalah ku mengalah
Salah aku salah
Sudah ku mengalah
Betapa aku mencintai
Tetapi masih kau sakiti
Aku tak bisa melupakan
Rasa sakit yang aku terima ho ho
Sakit aku sakit
Kalah ku mengalah
Salah aku salah
Sudah ku mengalah
Sakit aku sakit
Kalah ku mengalah
Salah aku salah
Sudah ku mengalah
Sudah ku mengalah"
Pura Pura Tak Tahu,Repvblik,"Disaat diriku bicara sendiri
Memikirkan kamu jatuhlah air mataku
Tapi ku tak bisa berpisah denganmu
Dan aku harap kau bisa berubah
Kau sakiti aku tapi ku tak terluka
Karena aku teramat sayang padamu
Kau permainkan aku
Bohongi diriku
Aku selalu diam
Pura pura tak tahu
Tak pernah terfikir meninggalkan kamu
Apa yang tak baik akan indah di akhirnya
Aku mampu bertahan di dalam senyuman
Dan aku harap kau bisa merubah
Kau sakiti aku tapi ku tak terluka
Karena aku teramat sayang padamu
Kau permainkan aku bohongi diriku
Aku selalu diam
Pura pura tak tahu
Ooo Kau bohongi aku hanya diam
Ooo Pura pura tak tahu
Kau sakiti aku tapi ku tak terluka
Karena aku teramat sayang padamu
Kau permainkan aku bohongi diriku
Aku selalu diam
Pura pura tak tahu
Aku selalu diam
Pura pura tak tahu
"
Ditinggal Sayang,Repvblik,"Masih kuingat senyum itu
Masih kuingat wajah itu
Saat kau bilang kepadaku
Hanya kaulah yang di hatiku
Semua hilang saat kau pergi meninggalkanku
Untuk hati yang lain
Kau pergi saat hatiku memberi semua ruang
Hanya untuk dirimu, hanya cintamu
Hancur isi hatiku
Saat kau pergi meninggalkanku
Leburkan impianku
Untuk menjadi pendamping hidupmu
Kurasa ku masih mencintaimu
Kurasa ku masih menyayangimu
Walau ku sakit hati
Masih kuingat senyum itu
Masih kuingat wajah itu
Saat kau bilang kepadaku
Hanya kaulah yang di hatiku
Semua hilang saat kau pergi meninggalkanku
Untuk hati yang lain
Kau pergi saat hatiku memberi semua ruang
Hanya untuk dirimu, hanya cintamu
Hancur isi hatiku
Saat kau pergi meninggalkanku
Leburkan impianku
Untuk menjadi pendamping hidupmu
Kurasa ku masih mencintaimu
Kurasa ku masih menyayangimu
Walau ku sakit hati
Walau ku sakit hati
Aku sakit hati"
Sudah Cukup,Repvblik,"Mungkin hati ini tak ingin kau kembali
Namun mimpi ini s'lalu aku banggakan
Dan di saat terindah bersama dirimu
'Kan s'lalu ada di setiap jejak langkahku
Dan tak pernah aku sesali cintaku untukmu
Karena bagiku t'lah milikimu sudah cukup untukku
Kemana pun aku pergi, s'lalu sepi tanpamu
Di mana pun aku berpijak, s'lalu hadir bayangmu
Kuteteskan air mata ini untukmu
Saat kau lepaskan cintaku untuk dirinya
Dan di saat terindah bersama dirimu
Kau s'lalu ada di setiap jejak langkahku
Dan tak pernah aku sesali cintaku untukmu
Karena bagiku t'lah milikimu sudah cukup untukku
Kemana pun aku pergi, s'lalu sepi tanpamu
Di mana pun aku berpijak, s'lalu hadir bayangmu
Dan tak pernah aku sesali cintaku untukmu
Karena bagiku t'lah milikimu sudah cukup untukku
Kemana pun aku pergi, s'lalu sepi tanpamu
Di mana pun aku berpijak, s'lalu hadir bayangmu"
Izinkan Aku Mencitaimu,Repvblik,"Sungguh benar ku cintaimu
Meski kau tak anggap ku ada
Ku tak akan memintamu untuk mencintaiku
Ku tak berharap kau cintaiku
Ku tak berharap kau balas cintaku
Yang ku harap kau izinkan aku mencintaimu
Cinta ini sudah terlanjur kumiliki dari dirimu
Biarkan cintaku bersamamu
Meski ragaku tak bisa bersamamu
Ku tak berharap kau cintaiku
Ku tak berharap kau balas cintaku
Yang ku harap kau izinkan aku mencintaimu
Cinta ini sudah terlanjur kumiliki dari dirimu
Biarkan cintaku bersamamu
Meski ragaku tak bisa bersamamu
Cinta ini sudah terlanjur kumiliki dari dirimu
Biarkan cintaku bersamamu
Meski ragaku tak bisa bersamamu
"
Seolah Aku Tak Ada,Repvblik,"Bagaimanakah bisa?
Aku mempertahankan
Hubungan kita
Yang mulai menjauh
Telah lama terasa
Ku tak banyak berkata
Biarkan sirna tanpa rencana
Katakan saja bila
Engkau mulai tak suka
Jangan hanya diam
Seolah aku tak ada
Aku tak sanggup lagi
Aku tak tahan lagi
Bila harus jalani
Cinta seperti ini
Kini saatnya ku pergi
Hidup sendiri tanpamu
Mengubur dalam-dalam
Cinta kita
Telah lama terasa
Ku tak banyak berkata
Biarkan sirna tanpa rencana
Katakan saja bila
Engkau mulai tak suka
Jangan hanya diam
Seolah aku tak ada
Aku tak sanggup lagi
Aku tak tahan lagi

Kini saatnya ku pergi
Hidup sendiri tanpamu
Mengubur dalam-dalam
Cinta kita
Aku tak sanggup lagi
Aku tak tahan lagi
Bila harus jalani
Cinta seperti ini
Kini saatnya ku pergi
Hidup sendiri tanpamu
Mengubur dalam-dalam
Cinta kita
Mengubur dalam-dalam
Cinta kita"
Jika Aku Mati,Repvblik,"Tak bisa kah kau renungkan
Semua kisah tentang kita berdua
Saat ego mu kuasai
Seluruh pikiranmu ini
Tak bisakah kau bayangkan
Angkuhnya dirimu itu
Saat kau merasa kau raja
Diatas semuanya di atas semua cinta
Dan cobalah kau mengerti
Bukan hanya kau yang mencintaiku
Tapi aku juga disini
Merasakan hal yang sama pada dirimu
Tak bisakah kau bayangkan
Angkuhnya dirimu itu
Saat kau merasa kau raja
Diatas semuanya di atas semua cinta
Mungkin nanti jika aku mati
Sesalmu akan abadi
Rasuki pikiranmu
Mungkin nanti jika aku mati
Sesalmu akan abadi
Rasuki pikiranmu uo
Dan cobalah kau mengerti
Bukan hanya kau yang mencintaiku
Tapi aku juga disini
Merasakan hal yang sama pada dirimu
Tak bisakah kau bayangkan
Angkuhnya dirimu itu
Saat kau merasa kau raja
Diatas semuanya di atas semua cinta
Mungkin nanti jika aku mati
Sesalmu akan abadi

Tanpa Mu,Repvblik,"Jangan bilang aku ini tak sayang
Apalagi aku tak peduli
Lihatlah diriku dari sisi yang lain
Lihat dalam hatiku dengan mata batinmu
Tanpamu aku bukan siapa - siapa
Tanpamu aku bukan apa - apa
Tanpamu aku bisa bisa gila
Tanpamu senyaplah dunia ini
Maafkan diriku bila romantisku tak bisa
Tak pandai aku memanjakanmu
Jangan bilang aku ini tak sayang

Duri Cinta,Repvblik,"Biar kisah cinta ini
Sampai disini sajalah
Jangan coba ganggu lagi
Aku t'lah kecewa
Dulu selalu kau ucapkan
Setiamu kepadaku
Tapi 'tuk saat ini
Kau duakan aku
Kau lebih memilih dia
Luka-luka hatiku
Perih-perih semua
Kau tancapkan duri cinta
Yang meracuni hidupku
Tolong aku Tuhan

Cintaku Sampai Disini Saja,Repvblik,"Maafkanlah sayang
Cinta ku sampai disini saja
Tak usah kau menangisi

Kasih Dengarkanlah,Repvblik,"Kasihku, dengarkanlah
Ingin kubicara
Tentang apa arti cinta
Yang t'lah kita rasa
Cinta bukanlah sekedar
Pengorbanan semata
Tapi, cinta punya rasa
Yang mengalahkan s'galanya
Biar kuungkapkan cinta
Walau cinta itu hampa
Hanya satu kubuktikan semua
Oh-wo, sayangku
Abadi semua rasa
Tulus di hatiku
Kau temani malam pekat
Berikan aku cahaya
Biar kuungkapkan cinta
Walau cinta itu hampa
Hanya satu kubuktikan semua
Oh-wo, sayangku
Biar kuungkapkan cinta
Walau cinta itu hampa
Hanya satu kubuktikan semua
Oh-wo, sayangku
Kau beri, kau rasa
Semua 'kan nyata

Simpanan Hatimu,Repvblik,"Saat kulepas semua keinginan
Bersama kamu dalam keheningan
Kupertanyakan apa arti cinta
Begitu saja kau hanyut terdiam
Sungguh sakit hati ini
Kau permainkan aku
Sepintar apa pun engkau menutupi
Tentang dia simpanan hatimu
Sebodoh apa pun aku akan tahu
Karena hati cuma satu
Dan jangan pernah kau bagi-bagi
Sepintar apa pun engkau menutupi
Tentang dia simpanan hatimu
Sebodoh apa pun aku akan tahu
Karena hati cuma satu
Dan jangan pernah kau bagi-bagi
Sepintar apa pun engkau menutupi
Tentang dia simpanan hatimu
Sebodoh apa pun aku akan tahu
Karnea hati cuma satu
Karena hati cuma satu
Dan jangan pernah kau bagi-bagi"
CInta Ini KIta Yang Punya,Repvblik,"Genggam tangan ini
Percaya padaku
Meski ada yang membenci
Ini cinta kita
Jalan masih panjang
Tak usah hiraukan
Tentang mereka
Yang tak sudi melihat cinta kita
Biarkanlah saja terserah apa

Cinta ini kita yang punya
Susah senang ini hidup kita
Jalan masih panjang
Tak usah hiraukan
Tentang mereka

Aku Yang Tertinggal,Repvblik,"Separuh jiwaku pergi
Menyusuri bayang bayangmu
Dulu ada segenap harapan
Dulu pernah ada cinta
Separuh hatiku terbang
Bersama serpihan kenangan
Kini aku harus melangkah
Melupakan itu semua
Aku yang terluka
Bukan dirimu
Takkan engkau mengerti
Tak bisa engkau pahami
Namun tak mengapa
Karena aku yang terluka
Separuh nafasku terhenti
Saat kau melangkah pergi
Ada yang cinta yang tak bertepi
Mungkin kau hanyalah mimpi
Separuh sadar ku berhenti
Terhenyap tanpa hadirmu
Mungkin tak sempat kau mengerti
Arti saling mencintai ho ho
Aku yang terluka
Bukan dirimu
Takkan engkau mengerti
Tak bisa engkau pahami

Kesempurnaan Cinta,Rizky Febian,"Kau dan aku tercipta oleh waktu
Hanya untuk saling mencintai

Cuek,Rizky Febian,"Kadang ku kesal dengan sikapmu
Yang s'lalu bertanya mana perhatianku
Mungkin kau tak pernah merasakan

Terlukis Indah,Rizky Febian,"Semenjak pertama ku jumpa dengannya
Ada rasa yang berbeda
Kutatap wajahmu tanpa ragu-ragu
Kumulai tersipu
Oh inilah cinta pertama bagi diri ini oh

Menari,Rizky Febian,"Salahkah bila ku mencinta?
Salahkah bila semua selalu tentangmu?
Izinkan agar kusampaikan
Ku tahu walau kau dengannya
Haruskah terdiam
Menahan semua rasa?
Inginnya kau dengar
Apa yang kurasa
Menari bersamaku
Temani hingga akhir waktu
Jalani bersamaku
Kau pasti 'kan bahagia
Kutemani dirimu di setiap perjalanan cinta
Menari bersamaku

Tak Lagi Sama,Rizky Febian,"Ketika rasa tak lagi sama
Cinta tak lagi sempurna
Kadang kehilangan arah
Inginnya 'ku tetap pertahankan
Dan tetap menjalani
Hari demi hari
Apa pun yang kau rasakan
Bagaimana kau menolak?
Rasa ini akan tetap sama
Aku 'kan bertahan
Cinta bukan tentang perasaan
Tapi janji yang terucap
Terucap kata cinta

Aminlah Bersamaku,Rizky Febian,"Alasanku memilihmu
Bukan karena cinta semata
Melainkan ku mengikuti hati ini oh
Ku sadari akan hadirmu
Sembuhkan sepi dihati
Kuyakin kau
Bersamamu
Hanyalah dirimu tujuan terakhirku

Ku Rindu Ibu,Rizky Febian,"Sempat terfikirkan 'tuk mengakhiri perjalanan ini
Lelah yang membuat perasaan hilang seketika
S'lalu ku mencoba 'tuk melabuhi perasaan ini
Inginnya kujujur 'tuk ungkapkan rasa
Sulit 'tuk diriku menerima semua
Inginnya kujujur 'tuk ungkapkan rasa
Betapa belum siapnya ku tanpamu
Haruskah terdiam lama
Ketika kau tak ada
Hingga menjadi debu
Hilang tak berbekas
Tapi kehilanganmu ternyata ku memburu
Harus melepas namun ku tak ingin
Ketika terlepas hanya tersisa penyesalan ini
Penyesalan ini, huu...
Tepukan ringan di pundakku menjadi penyemangat
Usapan rambutmu adalah bukti kasih
Meski ku tak sempat membalas itu semua
Kuyakin kau s'lalu memahami itu
Ibu, ibu, ibu maafkanlah atas perbuatanku
Ibu kumemohon maafkan atas kelakuan diriku
Yang tak pernah berbakti kepadamu
Yang lalaikan semuanya atas semua yang t'lah engkau berikan
Ibu, ibu, semoga kau s'lalu tenang di sana
Ku s'lalu mendoakan di setiap sujudku
Agar kau tahu betapa ku menyayangi dirimu
Agar kau tahu betapa sayangnya diriku
Walau kita tak lagi sama
Hanya ingin kuungkapkan
Ku rindu ibu
"
Seperti Kisah,Rizky Febian,"Seperti kisah yang pernah ada
Kaulah bidadari hati
Kita bersama buat cerita
Cinta antara kita
Kupernah terluka
Kadang tak berdaya
Kau s'lalu ada
Buatku tertawa
Dan lupakan lara
Tak tahu bagaimana
Aku tanpa dirimu
Tak pernah terbayangkan
Sepi merindu
Kumohon padamu
Tetaplah kau di sampingku
Hilangkan ragu
Semua yang kan menggangu
Kucinta padamu kasihku oh ho

Bila rindu pun melanda terhadapku
Terasa hati gelisah

Reuni,Rizky Febian,"Setelah kita berpisah tuk sekian lama
Akhirnya bisa bertemu kembali
Walau ku lihat engkau tersipu malu
Untuk mendekatkannya padaku
Ingin kuulangi kenangan itu
Indah saat kubersamamu
Apalah dayaku kau sudah bersamanya
Mungkin hanya sebuah reuni bagimu
Namun bagiku hanya awalan saja
Untuk memulai cerita kita yang baru
Bertemu kembali
Walau hanya sebentar kita bersama
Namun jujur bagiku sangat berarti
Ingin kuulangi kenangan itu
Indah saat kubersamamu
Apalah dayaku kau sudah bersamanya oh
Mungkin hanya sebuah reuni bagimu
Namun bagiku hanya awalan saja
Untuk memulai cerita kita yang baru
Mungkin hanya sebuah reuni bagimu
Namun bagiku hanya awalan saja
Untuk memulai cerita kita yang baru
Tak mungkin kulupakan
Cerita indah berdua
Sudahlah simpan itu semua
Tuk dikenang selamanya
Mungkin hanya sebuah reuni bagimu
Namun bagiku hanya awalan saja
Untuk memulai cerita kita yang baru
Mungkin hanya sebuah reuni bagimu
Namun bagiku hanya awalan saja
Untuk memulai cerita kita yang baru
Mungkin hanya sebuah reuni bagimu
Namun bagiku hanya awalan saja
Untuk memulai cerita kita yang baru"
Menikahimu,Rohitna,"Menantimu hingga saat
Cintaku temukan dirimu
Usai sudah sampai di sini
Berdiri melabuhkan asmara
Menikah denganku
Menempatkan cinta
Melintasi perjalanan usia
Menikah denganmu
Menetapkan jiwa
Bertahtakan kesetiaan cinta
Selamanya"
Kamu Yang Kutunggu,Rossa,"Telah kutemukan
Yang aku impikan
Kamu yang sempurna
Segala kekurangan
Semua kelemahan
Kau jadikan cinta
Tanpamu
Aku tak bisa berjalan
Mencari cinta sejati
Tak kutemukan
Darimu
Aku bisa merasakan
Kesungguhan hati
Cinta yang sejati
Karnamu
Dikirim Tuhan
Untuk melengkapiku
Tuk jaga hatiku
Karnamu
Hasrat terindah
Untuk cintaku
Takkan cemas
Ku percaya kamu
Karena kau jaga
Tulus cintamu
Ternyata
Kamu yang kutunggu"
Ayat-ayat cinta,Rossa,"Desir pasir di padang tandus
Segersang pemikiran hati
Terkisah ku di antara cinta yang rumit
Bila keyakinanku datang
Kasih bukan sekadar cinta
Pengorbanan cinta yang agung
Ku pertaruhkan
Maafkan bila ku tak sempurna
Cinta ini tak mungkin ku cegah
Ayat-ayat cinta bercerita
Cintaku padamu
Bila bahagia mulai menyentuh
Seakan ku bisa hidup lebih lama
Namun harus ku tinggalkan cinta
Ketika ku bersujud
Bila keyakinanku datang
Kasih bukan sekedar cinta
Pengorbanan cinta yang agung
Ku pertaruhkan
Maafkan bila ku tak sempurna
Cinta ini tak mungkin ku cegah
Ayat-ayat cinta bercerita
Cintaku padamu
Bila bahagia mulai menyentuh
Seakan ku bisa hidup lebih lama
Namun harus ku tinggalkan cinta
Ketika ku bersujud

Atas Nama Cinta,Rossa,"Aku wanita
Yang punya cinta di hati
Ada dirimu dan dirinya
Dalam hidupku
Mengapa terlambat
Cintamu t'lah termiliki
Sedang diriku dengan dia
Tak begitu cinta
Mengapa yang lain bisa
Mendua dengan mudahnya
Namun kita terbelenggu
Dalam ikatan tanpa cinta
Atas nama cinta
Hati ini tak mungkin terbagi
Sampai nanti bila aku mati
Cinta ini hanya untuk engkau
Atas nama cinta
Kurelakan jalanku merana
Asal engkau akhirnya denganku
Ku bersumpah atas nama cinta
Mengapa yang lain bisa
Mendua dengan mudahnya
Namun kita terbelenggu
Dalam ikatan tanpa cinta
Atas nama cinta
Hati ini tak mungkin terbagi
Sampai nanti bila aku mati
Cinta ini hanya untuk engkau
Atas nama cinta
Kurelakan jalanku merana
Asal engkau akhirnya denganku
Ku bersumpah atas nama cinta
Atas nama cinta"
Terlalu Cinta,Rossa,"Jangan dekat atau jangan datang kepadaku lagi
Aku semakin tersiksa karena tak memilikimu
Kucoba jalani hari dengan pengganti dirimu
Tapi hatiku selalu berpihak lagi padamu
Mengapa semua ini terjadi kepadaku
Tuhan maafkan diri ini
Yang tak pernah bisa menjauh dari angan tentangnya
Namun apalah daya ini
Bila ternyata sesungguhnya aku terlalu cinta diaэ
Tapi hatiku selalu berpihak lagi padamu
Mengapa semua ini terjadi kepadaku
Tuhan maafkan diri ini
Yang tak pernah bisa menjauh dari angan tentangnya
Namun apalah daya ini
Bila ternyata sesungguhnya aku terlalu cinta dia
Mengapa semua ini terjadi kepadaku
Tuhan maafkan diri ini
Yang tak pernah bisa menjauh dari angan tentangnya
Namun apalah daya ini
Bila ternyata sesungguhnya aku terlalu cinta diaэ"
Aku Jatuh Cinta,Roulette,"Awalnya ku tak mengerti apa yang sedang kurasakan
Segalanya berubah dan rasa rindu itu pun ada
Sejak kau hadir di setiap malam di tidurku
Aku tahu sesuatu sedang terjadi padaku
Sudah sekian lama kualami pedih putus cinta
Dan mulai terbiasa hidup sendiri tanpa asmara
Dan hadirmu membawa cinta sembuhkan lukaku
Kau berbeda dari yang kukira
Aku jatuh cinta kepada dirinya
Sunguh-sungguh cinta, oh, apa adanya
Tak pernah kuragu namun tetap selalu menunggu
Sungguh aku jatuh cinta kepadanya
Coba, coba dengarkan apa yang ingin aku katakan
Yang selama ini sungguh telah lama terpendam
Aku tak percaya, membuatku tak berdaya
Tuk ungkapkan apa yang kurasa
Kadang aku cemburu, kadang aku gelisah
Seringnya ku tak tentu lalui hariku
Tak dapat kupungkiri hatiku yang terdalam
Betapa aku jatuh cinta kepadanya
Apa adanya
Tak pernah ragu
Dan tetap menunggu
Sungguh aku jatuh cinta"
Mesra-Mesraannya kecil-kecilan dulu,Sal Priadi,"Ba, sementara
Kita mesra-mesraannya
Kecil-kecilan dulu, ya
Tunggu sampai semua mereda
'Kan kukenalkan
Penampilan hujan di tempat lain
Pemandangan bagus di tempat yang jauh
Bukan yang di dekat rumah saja

Banyak kejadian yang menarik
Koleksi suasana asyik
Perasaan-p'rasaan yang baik
Cintanya besar-besaran
Meski mesranya kecil-kecilan
Ba, sementara
Kita mesra-mesraannya
Kecil-kecilan dulu, ya

Jatuh Cinta,Sammy Simorangkir,"Tiada rasa yang lebih indah ketika kau jatuh cinta
Semua terasa begitu berwarna
Saat kau berjumpa dengannya
Ada rasa yang tak biasa
Saat kau belai wajahku
Lembut jemarimu menyentuh wajahku

Mengisi hari yang lama sepi
Terlalu lama aku mendamba
Kiniku merasa aku tlah jatuh cinta
Ada rasa yang tak biasa
Saat kau tatap mataku
Binar dimatamu yakinkan diriku
Hanya kamu satu cintaku
Tiada rasa yang lebih indah
Saat kau kecup bibirku
Kau buat diriku merasa sempurna
Seolah dunia milik kita

Pengorbanan,Setia Band,"Kisahku kini terasa berbeda

Kita,Sheila on 7,"Di saat kita bersama
Di waktu kita tertawa, menangis, merenung
Oleh cinta
Kau coba hapuskan rasa
Rasa di mana kau melayang jauh dari jiwaku
Juga mimpiku
Biarlah, biarlah
Hariku dan harimu
Terbelenggu satu
Oleh ucapan manismu
Dan kau bisikkan kata cinta
Kau telah percikkan rasa sayang
Pastikan kita seirama
Walau terikat rasa hina
Sekilas kau tampak layu
Jika kau rindukan gelak tawa yang warnai
Lembar jalan kita
Reguk dan teguklah
Mimpiku dan mimpimu
Terbelenggu satu
Oleh ucapan janjimu"
Mari Bercinta,Sheila on 7,"Saat kau peroleh rasa dalam makna cinta
Dan hiraukan semua angkara
Hanya satu buah titah yang kami ejawantah
Terlalu banyak cinta kan binasa
Yang indah kau rasa
Yang manis kau beri
Walau itu hanya sementara
Lihat dirimu
Semakin jauh mengayuh
Lewati segala tujuan hidup
Yang mungkin kau tempuh
Tentukan yang utama yang satu tercinta
Kan jadi teman hidup yg setia"
Anugerah Terindah Yang Pernah Kumiliki,Sheila on 7,"Melihat tawamu
Mendengar senandungmu
Terlihat jelas di mataku
Warna-warna indahmu
Menatap langkahmu
Meratapi kisah hidupmu
Terlihat jelas bahwa hatimu
Anugerah terindah yang pernah kumiliki

Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh-ho
Sifatmu nan s'lalu
Redakan ambisiku
Tepikan khilafku
Dari bunga yang layu
Saat kau di sisiku
Kembali dunia ceria
Tegaskan bahwa kamu
Anugerah terindah yang pernah kumiliki

Mimpi burukmu
Di mana telah kutancapkan duri tajam
Kau pun menangis, menangis sedih
Maafkan aku
Dan...
Bukan maksudku, bukan inginku
Melukaimu
Sadarkah kau di sini ku pun terluka
Melupakanmu, menepikanmu

"Lihat, Dengar, Rasakan
",Sheila on 7,"Dia telah berdiri
Coba berlari
Tak pernah dia jelang
Hidup yang inginkan
Kilau hari-hari
Dan birunya langit
Terhapus rasa indah
Terpejam oleh lelah
Dalam lelahnya mata
Nikmat dunia menjelma
Sejenak dia berharap
Malam tanpa batas
Bunda slalu tanamkan
Jangan pernah menyerah
Jalani dan panjatkan
Kelak syukur kau ucapkan pada diri Nya
Kumohonkan mudahkan hidupnya hiasi dengan belai Mu
Sucikan tangan-tangan yang memegang erat harta
Terangi harinya dengan lembut mentari Mu
Buka genggaman yang telah menjadi hak mereka
Kumohonkan mudahkan hidupnya hiasi dengan belai Mu
Sucikan tangan-tangan yang memegang erat harta
Terangi harinya dengan lembut mentari Mu
Buka genggaman yang telah menjadi hak mereka
Mudahkan hidupnya hiasi dengan belai Mu
Terangi harinya
Buka genggaman yang telah menjadi hak mereka"
Sahabat Sejati,Sheila on 7,"Sahabat sejatiku
Hilangkah dari ingatanmu
Di hari kita saling berbagi
Dengan kotak sejuta mimpi
Aku datang menghampirimu
Kuperlihatkan semua hartaku

Kesombongan di masa muda yang indah
Aku raja kaupun raja
Aku hitam kaupun hitam
Arti teman lebih dari sekedar materi
Pegang pundakku, jangan pernah lepaskan
Bila kumulai lelah?
Lelah dan tak bersinar
Remas sayapku, jangan pernah Lepaskan
Bila kuingin terbang?
Terbang meninggalkanmu
Ku s'lalu membanggakanmu
Kaupun s'lalu menyanjungku
Aku dan kamu darah abadi
Demi bermain bersama
Kita duakan segalanya
Merdeka kita, kita merdeka
Pegang pundakku, jangan pernah lepaskan
Bila kumulai lelah?
Lelah dan tak bersinar
Remas sayapku, jangan pernah lepaskan
Bila kuingin terbang?
Terbang meninggalkanmu
Tak pernah kita pikirkan ujung perjalanan ini
Tak usah kita pikirkan ujung perjalanan ini
Dan tak usah kita pikirkan ujung perjalanan ini

"Bila Kau Tak Disampingku
",Sheila on 7,"Tak seharusnya kita terpisah
Tak semestinya kita bertengkar
Karna diriku masih butuh kau
Maafkanlah sikapku
Lupakanlah salahku itu
Terlalu bodoh untuk diriku
Menahan berat jutaan rindu
Apalagi menahan egoku
Maafkanlah sikapku
Lupakanlah salahku
Luapkan kepadaku
Takkan kubiarkan kau menangis
Takkan kubiarkan kau terkikis
Terluka perasaan oleh semua ucapanku
Maafkanlah semua sifat kasarku
Bukan maksud untuk melukaimu
Aku hanyalah orang yang penuh rasa cemburu
Bila kau tak di sampingku
Terlalu bodoh untuk diriku
Menahan berat jutaan rindu
Apalagi menahan egoku
Maafkanlah sikapku
Lupakanlah salahku
Luapkan kepadaku
Takkan kubiarkan kau menangis
Takkan kubiarkan kau terkikis
Terluka perasaan oleh semua ucapanku
Maafkanlah semua sifat kasarku
Bukan maksud untuk melukaimu
Aku hanyalah orang yang penuh rasa cemburu
Dan bila kau tak di sampingku
Bila kau tak di sampingku
Bila kau tak di sampingku"
Berhenti Berharap,Sheila on 7,"Aku tak percaya lagi
Dengan apa yang kau beri
Aku terdampar di sini
Tersudut menunggu mati
Aku tak percaya lagi
Akan guna matahari
Yang dulu mampu terangi
Sudut gelap hati ini
Aku berhenti berharap
Dan menunggu datang gelap
Sampai nanti suatu saat
Tak ada cinta kudapat
Kenapa ada derita
Bila bahagia tercipta
Kenapa ada sang hitam
Bila putih menyenangkan
Aku pulang
Tanpa dendam
Kuterima kekalahanku
Aku pulang
Tanpa dendam
Kusalutkan kemenanganmu
Kau ajarkan aku bahagia
Kau ajarkan aku derita
Kau tunjukkan aku bahagia
Kau tunjukkan aku derita
Kau berikan aku bahagia
Kau berikan aku derita
Aku pulang
Tanpa dendam
Ku terima kekalahanku
Rebahkan kalbumu
Lepaskan perlahan
Kau akan mengerti
Semua
Aku berhenti berharap
Dan menunggu datang gelap
Sampai nanti suatu saat
Tak ada cinta kudapat"
Melompat Lebih Tinggi,Sheila on 7,"Kita berlari dan terus 'kan bernyanyi
Kita buka lebar pelukan mentari
Bila ku terjatuh nanti
Kau siap mengangkat aku lebih tinggi
Uh, uh, uh
Seperti pedih yang telah kita bagi
Layaknya luka yang telah terobati
Bila kita jatuh nanti
Kita siap 'tuk melompat lebih tinggi
Bersama kita bagai hutan dan hujan
Aku ada kar'na kau telah tercipta, ha-ah
Kupetik bintang untuk kau simpan
Cahayanya tenang, berikan kau perlindungan
Sebagai pengingat teman
Juga s'bagai jawaban semua tantangan
Kupetik bintang untuk kau simpan
Cahayanya tenang, berikan kau perlindungan
Sebagai pengingat teman
Juga s'bagai jawaban semua tantangan
Sebelum waktu memisahkan detikku, detikmu
Sebelum dewasa, menua memisahkan kita
Degupan jantung kita akan s'lalu seirama
Bila kau rindu aku
Kupetik bintang untuk kau simpan
Cahayanya tenang, berikan kau perlindungan
Sebagai pengingat teman
Juga s'bagai jawaban semua tantangan
Kupetik bintang untuk kau simpan
Cahayanya tenang, berikan kau perlindungan
Sebagai pengingat teman
Juga s'bagai jawaban semua tantangan"
Untuk Perempuan,Sheila on 7,"Jangan mengejarnya, jangan mencarinya
Dia yang 'kan menemukanmu
Kau mekar di hatinya di hari yang tepat
Jangan mengejarku dan jangan mencariku
Aku yang 'kan menemukanmu
Kau mekar di hatiku di hari yang tepat
Tidaklah mawar hampiri kumbang
Bukanlah cinta bila kau kejar
Tenanglah, tenang, dia 'kan datang
Dan memungutmu ke hatinya yang terdalam
Bahkan dia takkan bertahan tanpamu
Sibukkan harimu, jangan pikirkan 'ku
Hadirnya 'kan menuntunku
Pulang kepadamu di hari yang tepat
Tidaklah mawar hampiri kumbang
Bukanlah cinta bila kau kejar
Tenanglah, tenang, aku 'kan datang
Dan memungutmu ke hatiku yang terdalam
Bahkan 'ku takkan bertahan tanpamu, oh
Aku yang 'kan datang
Aku yang 'kan datang
Aku yang 'kan datang
Aku yang 'kan datang

Betapa,Sheila on 7,"Seminggu setelah kau pergi
Teman silih berganti
Menghiburku
Berkata semua teratasi
Dan terus sembunyi
Di balik senyum palsu
Ku dengar dirimu
Tak sendiri lagi
Betapa hancurnya
Hati dan jiwaku
Setahun setelah kau pergi
Ku masih sembunyi
Di balik senyum palsu
Ku dengar dirimu
Tak sendiri lagi
Betapa hancurnya
Hati dan jiwaku
Betapa hancurnya
Tolong bantu aku
Melewati semua
Betapa hancurnya
Hati dan jiwaku
Betapa betapa"
"Jalan Keluar
",Sheila on 7,"Sepucat bulan purnama
Segelap malam tergelap
Ku biarkan ku mencari
Hatimu yang tak pernah kau beri
Sedalam palung lautan
Sedalam jurang hatimu
Kau biarkan ku jatuh tanpa ujung
Lepaskan sayapku yang terpasung
Jika memang tiada harapan
Tunjukkan jalan keluar dari hatimu
Sedalam palung lautan
Sedalam jurang hatimu
Kau biarkan ku jatuh tanpa ujung
Lepaskan sayapku yang terpasung oh
Jika memang tiada harapan
Tunjukkan jalan keluar dari hatimu
Jika memang tak akan bersanding
Tunjukkan jalan keluar dari hatimu
Jika memang tiada harapan
Tunjukkan jalan keluar dari hatimu oh
Jika memang tak akan bersanding
Tunjukkan jalan keluar dari hatimu"
Alasanku,Sheila on 7,"Aku telah salah
Ragukan niatmu
Akulah lelaki
Dengan jiwa bocah
Yang coba dewasa
Yang coba berubah
Mohon dampingilah
Jangan tinggalkan
Ho ho-uu
Tak terbayangkan
Jika kau pergi
Kau alasanku untuk dewasa
Dan aku tak ingin kau terluka
Segenap jiwa akan kujaga
Keinda-han-mu
Menepis sejenak denganku
Bahagia s'lamanya denganku
Kau alasanku untuk dewasa
Dan aku tak ingin kau terluka
Segenap jiwa akan kujaga
Keinda-han-mu
Keinda-han
Mu
Ha-aa ha-aa"
Hujan Turun,Sheila on 7,"Tak ada waktu 'tuk menjelaskan
Tak sangka ini 'kan datang
Tiap liku berbagi hidup
Sejenak melepas lelah
Kau tinggalkan diriku
Waktu hujan turun
Di sudut gelap mataku
Begitu derasnya
'Kan kucoba bertahan
Ingat kembali yang terjadi
Tiap langkah yang kita pilih
Meski terkadang perih
Harapan untuk yang terbaik
Sekeras karang kita coba
Tetap kau tinggal diriku
Waktu hujan turun
Di sudut gelap mataku
Begitu derasnya
'Kan kucoba bertahan
Waktu hujan turun
Di sudut gelap mataku
Begitu derasnya
'Kan kucoba bertahan
Tak akan kuhalangi
Walau 'ku tak ingin kau pergi
'Kan kubangun rumah ini
Walau tanpa dirimu
Walau tanpa dirimu
Waktu hujan turun
Di sudut gelap mataku
Begitu derasnya
'Kan kucoba bertahan
Waktu hujan turun
Di sudut gelap mataku
Begitu derasnya
'Kan kucoba bertahan"
`,Sherina Munaf,"Sebelumnya tak ada yang mampu
Mengajakku untuk bertahan
Di kala sedih
Sebelumnya kuikat hatiku
Hanya untuk aku seorang
Sekarang kau di sini
Hilang rasanya
Semua bimbang tangis kesepian
Kau buat aku bertanya
Kau buat aku mencari
Tentang rasa ini
Aku tak mengerti
Akankah sama jadinya
Bila bukan kamu
Lalu senyummu menyadarkanku
Kau cinta pertama dan terakhirku
Bila suatu saat
Kau harus pergi
Jangan paksa aku
Tuk cari yang lebih baik"
Ada Cinta,Smash,"Ada cinta yang kurasakan
Saat bertatap dalam canda

Tuhan kuingin tahu semoga semua ini (segalanya)
Bukan hanya rasa, rasaku saja, rasaku sendiri

I got the feeling 'cause you making me smiling
Thinking of you pusing tujuh keliling
'Ku merasa oh ada cinta

Cinta Tak Harus Memiliki,ST 12,"Cinta memang tak selama nya bisa indah
Cinta juga bisa berubah menjadi sakit
Begitu yang kurasakan kini
Perih hatiku tinggal kehancuran
Tak pernah terbayangkan
Dan tak pernah terpikirkan
Cintamu dan cintaku akan berpisah
Namun harus kurelakan itu
Untuk hidupmu agar lebih baik
Maafkan aku
Setulus hatimu
Kepergian diriku itu bukan keinginanku
Terima saja dengan pilihan yang lain dari orang tuamu
Jangan bersedih dengan keadaan ini
Jika kamu menangis
Aku juga ikut menangis
Terima saja semua ini kulakukan
Untukmu
Maafkan aku
Setulus hatimu
Kepergian diriku itu bukan keinginanku
Terima saja dengan pilihan yang lain dari orang tuamu
Oh jangan bersedih dengan keadaan ini

Saat Terakhir,ST 12,"Tak pernah terpikir olehku
Tak sedikit pun kubayangkan
Kau akan pergi
Tinggalkan ku sendiri
Begitu sulit kubayangkan
Begitu sakit kurasakan
Kau akan pergi
Tinggalkan ku sendiri
Di bawah batu nisan, kini kau t'lah sandarkan
Kasih sayang kamu begitu dalam
Sungguh, ku tak sanggup ini terjadi
Kar'na ku sangat cinta
Inilah saat terakhirku melihat kamu
Jatuh air mataku, menangis pilu
Hanya mampu ucapkan
""S'lamat jalan, kasih""
Satu jam saja, ku telah bisa
Cintai kamu, kamu, kamu di hatiku
Namun bagiku melupakanmu
Butuh waktuku seumur hidup
Satu jam saja, ku telah bisa
Sayangi kamu di hatiku
Namun bagiku melupakanmu
Butuh waktuku seumur hidup
Di nantiku
Wo-oh, wo-oh
Oh-ho-oh

Rasa Yang Tertinggal,ST 12,"Bila asmaraku telah tiba
Merenggut nafas dijiwa
Itu dia yang datang hadirkan cinta
Menyebar ke dalam rasa
Dapatkah ku mengatakannya
Perasaan yang ku punya
Untuk dia mestinya ku ungkapkan saja
Tuk dapat jawaban darinya
Dapatkah aku memeluknya
Menjadikan bintang di Surga
Memberikan warna yang bisa
Menjadikan indah
Aku tak mampu mengatakan
Aku tak mampu tuk mengungkapkan
Hingga sampai saat ini
Perasaan tlah tertinggal
Dapatkah dia merasakan
Satu nafas yang tersimpan
Itu bukan cinta
Sekedar cinta biasa
Yang sesaat dan trus hilang
Dapatkah aku memeluknya
Menjadikan bintang di Surga
Memberikan warna yang bisa
Menjadikan indah
Aku tak mampu mengatakan
Aku tak mampu tuk mengungkapkan
Hingga sampai saat ini
Perasaan tlah tertinggal
Dapatkah aku memeluknya
Menjadikan bintang di Surga
Memberikan warna yang bisa
Menjadikan indah
Aku tak mampu mengatakan
Aku tak mampu tuk mengungkapkan
Hingga sampai saat ini
Perasaan tlah tertinggal
Dapatkah aku memeluknya
Ku jadikan bintang-bintang di Surga
Memberikan warna yang bisa
Dan teruslah bisa
Menjadikan indah"
Putri Iklan,ST 12,"Aku yang terlelap sendiri
Terlelap sampai tak sadar diri
Kulihat sang Pujaan Hati
Datang melangkah, t'rus menghampiri

Hu
Hanyalah dirimu
Yang selalu kurindu
Kutunggu
Oh wo
Selama masih ada hati
Tuk menjaga rasa
Percayalah kita satu
Meski harus jauh
Rinduku hanya tuk dirimu
Selama masih ada hati
Tuk menjaga rasa
Percayalah kita satu
Meskipun kita jauh
Hidupku tuk kamu
Hanya tuk dirimu
"
Anti‐Hero,Taylor Swift,"I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis (tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
At tea time, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero
Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman? (Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At tea time, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero
I have this dream my daughter in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
""She's laughing up at us from hell""
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi, everybody agrees, everybody agrees
It's me, hi (hi), I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At tea (tea) time (time), everybody agrees (everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero"
Love Story,Taylor Swift,"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standin' there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was cryin' on the staircase
Beggin' you, ""Please don't go, "" and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh oh
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was beggin' you, ""Please don't go, "" and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're tryna tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Oh, oh
I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said
Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said, ""Marry me, Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you"
Bad Blood,Taylor Swift,"Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood (hey!)
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood (hey!)
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin
What was shining? Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me
Where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times
You and I
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood (hey!)
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood (hey!)
Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past
These kind of wounds they last and they last
Now did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you come in my way, just don't
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times
You and I
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood (hey!)
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood (hey!)
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (ghosts, ghosts)
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes (hey!)
You say sorry just for show (hey!)
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (hey!)
Hm, if you love like that, blood runs cold
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood (hey!)
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em (think we can solve 'em)
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood (hey!)
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done (look what you've done)
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood (hey!)
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood (hey!)"
Blank Space,Taylor Swift,"Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"" Ay
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young, and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
""Oh, my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young, and we're reckless (oh)
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm (oh)
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (insane)
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over (over)
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (I'm insane)

But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name"
Look What You Made Me Do,Taylor Swift,"I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play of the fool
No, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (oh!)
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I got a list of names, and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me...
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
I (I) don't (don't) like your kingdom keys (keys)
They (they) once belonged to me (me)
You (you) asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (what?)
The world moves on, another day another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time (nick of time)
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time (I do it all the time)
I got a list of names, and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me...
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I'm sorry
But the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now
Why? Oh, 'cause she's dead (oh)
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me...
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do

"You Belong With Me
",Taylor Swift,"You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do
But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So, why can't you see?
You belong with me
You belong with me
Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile
That can light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while
Since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?
She wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So, why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me
You belong with me
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me
Can't you see that I'm the one
Who understands you?
Been here all along
So, why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me
You belong with me
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me"
Bejeweled,Taylor Swift,"Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind
Didn't notice you walking all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five
And by the way, I'm going out tonight
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, ""Do you have a man?""
I can still say, ""I don't remember""
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real, I polish up real nice
Nice
Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl (too good of a girl)
Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve
I think it's time to teach some lessons
I made you my world (huh), have you heard? (Huh)
I can reclaim the land
And I miss you (I miss you)
But I miss sparkling (ah, hey)
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, ""Do you have a man?""
I can still say, ""I don't remember""
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real, I polish up real nice
Nice
Sapphire tears on my face
Sadness became my whole sky
But some guy said my aura's moonstone
Just 'cause he was high
And we're dancin' all night
And you can try to change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do?
A diamond's gotta shine
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer (shimmer)
And when I meet the band
They ask, ""Do you have a man?""
I can still say, ""I don't remember""
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real (nice), I polish up real nice
And we're dancin' all night
And you can try to change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do? What's a girl gonna do?
I polish up nice
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer"
"Shake it Off
",Taylor Swift,"I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm
I go on to many dates, ha-ha
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm
But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying, ""It's gonna be alright
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, I shake it off
I never miss a beat
I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
I'm dancing on my own (Dancing on my own)
I make the moves up as I go (Moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't know, mmm-mmm
But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop grooving
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying, ""It's gonna be alright.""
""Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate

I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
Hey, hey, hey
Just think, while you've been getting down and out about
The liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world
You could've been getting down to this sick beat
My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like ""Oh, my God"", but I'm just gonna shake
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby?
We can shake, shake
Shake
Yeah, yeah
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonns hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break

I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off, you've got to
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off"
Don’t Blame Me,Taylor Swift,"Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
I've been breakin' hearts a long time, and
Toyin' with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Something happened for the first time, in
The darkest little paradise
Shakin, pacin', I just need you
For you, I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say, ""She's gone too far this time""
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
My name is whatever you decide
And I'm just gonna call you mine
I'm insane, but I'm your baby (your baby)
Echoes (echoes) of your name inside my mind
Halo, hiding my obsession
I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy
And baby, for you, I (I) would (would) fall from grace
Just (just) to (to) touch your face
If (if) you (you) walk away
I'd beg you on my knees to stay
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

I get so high, oh
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
You're lovin' me
Trip of my life, oh
Every time you're, every time you're touchin' me
You're touchin' me
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
Oh Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

You're lovin' me
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life"
All Too Well,Taylor Swift,"I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something about it felt like home somehow
And I, left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer even now
Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You told me 'bout your past thinking your future was me
And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah
And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well"
Enchanted,Taylor Swift,"There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you
Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
'Cross the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
The lingering question kept me up
2 AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, ""Hey""
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is, I was enchanted to meet you
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
That this night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name, until I see you again
These are the words I held back, as I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you"
Back to December,Taylor Swift,"I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die
So this is me swallowin' my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time
These days, I haven't been sleepin'
Stayin' up playin' back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughin' from the passenger's side
And realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye
So this is me swallowin' my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinkin'
Probably mindless dreamin'
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand
But this is me swallowin' my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
All the time"
Wildest Dreams,Taylor Swift,"He said, ""Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds""
I thought Heaven can't help me now
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha
I said, ""No one has to know what we do""
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good now
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha (ha-ah, ha)
Wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning (burning) it (it) down (down)
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow (follow) you (you) around (follow you around)
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just (pretend, just pretend) in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha (ah)
In your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha
Even if it's just stayed in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha
In your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha"
Gorgeous,Taylor Swift,"You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doing, I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much (I hate you so much)
Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life, by not being mine
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But, what can I say?
You're gorgeous
You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talking to everyone here but you (but you, but you)
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in the darkened room (dark room, dark room)
If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts
(Honey, it hurts)
Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (to your face)
'Cause look at your face (look at your face)
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous
You make me so happy, it turns back to sad, yeah
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad
You make me so happy, it turns back to sad, yeah
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats
Alone, unless you wanna come along, oh
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (to your face)
'Cause look at your face (look at your face)
And I'm so furious (I'm so furious)
At you for making me feel this way (feel this way)
But what can I say? (I say)
You're gorgeous
You make me so happy, it turns back to sad, yeah
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad
You're gorgeous
You make me so happy, it turns back to sad, yeah
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad
You're gorgeous"
Midnight Rain,Taylor Swift,"Rain, he wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight
My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some, it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow-motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart 'cause he was nice
He was sunshine, I was midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight
It came like a postcard
Picture perfect, shiny family
Holiday, peppermint candy
But for him it's every day
So I peered through a window
A deep portal, time travel
All the love we unravel
And the life I gave away
'Cause he was sunshine
I was midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight
Rain, he wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight
I guess sometimes we all get
Just what we wanted, just what we wanted
And he never thinks of me
Except when I'm on TV
I guess sometimes we all get
Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted
And I never think of him
Except on midnights like this (midnights like this)"
Lover,Taylor Swift,"We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my
Lover
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Lover
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my
Lover"
Style,Taylor Swift,"Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you (heard from you)
And I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white T-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road, mm
Takes me home
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat, mm, yeah
I say, ""I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl, some other girl""
He says, ""What you heard is true, but I
Can't stop thinkin' 'bout you and I""
I said, ""I've been there too a few times""
'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white T-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (a tight little skirt)
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style (we never go), we never go out of style
Take me home
Just take me home
Yeah, just take me home
Oh, whoa, oh
(Out of style)
Oh, you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down (now we go), we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style"
We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,Taylor Swift,"I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space. (What?)
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me.""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you.""

Ooh, we called it off again last night
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Like, ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Ooh, you called me up again tonight
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Ooh, yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Oh oh oh

I used to think that we were forever ever
And I used to say, ""Never say never...""
Uggg... so he calls me up and he's like, ""I still love you,""
And I'm like... ""I just... I mean this is exhausting, you know, like
We are never getting back together. Like, ever""

No!

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

We, ooh, getting back together, ohhh
We, ooh, getting back together

You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together"
cardigan,Taylor Swift,"Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothin'
But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in 20 lifetimes, I
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite"
Cruel Summer,Taylor Swift,"Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it
Bad, bad boy
Shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa, oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you
Hang your head low
In the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying
You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know
Oh, it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa, oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa, oh
It's a cruel summer
With you
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh)
Said, ""I'm fine, "" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (oh)
And I screamed for whatever it's worth
""I love you, "" ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?
He looks up grinning like a devil
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa, oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules, in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa, oh
It's a cruel summer
With you
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (h)
Said, ""I'm fine, "" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (oh)
And I screamed for whatever it's worth
""I love you, "" ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
Dress,Taylor Swift,"Our secret moments in your crowded room
They've got no idea about me and you
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo
All of this silence and patience, pining in anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you (ah, ah, ah)
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from holding back from all this (ha, ha, ha, ha)
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off (ha, ha, ha)
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off (ha, ha, ha, ha)
Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try
And if I get burned, at least we were electrified
I'm spilling wine in the bathtub, you kiss my face and we're both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us, but they know nothing about
All of this silence and patience, pining in anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you (ah, ah, ah)
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from holding back from all this (ha, ha, ha, ha)
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off (ha, ha, ha)
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off (ha, ha, ha, ha)
Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off (ha, ha, ha, ha)
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Flashback when you met me
Your buzzcut and my hair bleached
Even in my worst times, you could see the best of me
Flashback to my mistakes
My rebounds, my earthquakes
Even in my worst lies, you saw the truth of me
And I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My one and only, my lifeline
I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My hands shake, I can't explain this (ha, ha, ha, ha)
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off (ha, ha, ha, ha)
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off (ha, ha, ha, ha)
There is an indentation
In the shape of you
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
You made your mark on me, golden tattoo
Only bought this dress so you could take it off"
Sweet Nothing,Taylor Swift,"I spy with my little tired eye
Tiny as a firefly
A pebble that we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?
Ooh...
They said the end is coming
Everyone's up to something
I find myself running home to your
Sweet nothings
Outside they're push and shoving
You're in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was
Sweet nothing
On the way home
I wrote a poem
You say, ""what a mind""
This happens all the time
Ooh...
'Cause they said the end is coming
Everyone's up to something
I find myself running home to your
Sweet nothings
Outside they're push and shoving
You're in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was
... nothing
Industry disrupters and soul deconstructors
And smooth-talking hucksters
Out glad-handing each other
And the voices that implore
""You should be doing more""
To you I can admit
That I'm just too soft for all of it
Ooh...
They said the end is coming
Everyone's up to something
I find myself running home to your
Sweet nothings
Outside they're push and shoving
You're in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was
Sweet nothing
They said the end is coming
Everyone's up to something
I find myself running home to your
Sweet nothings
Outside they're push and shoving
You're in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was
Sweet nothing"
You Need to Calm Down,Taylor Swift,"You are somebody that I don't know
But you're taking shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like ""Damn, it's 7:00 a.m.""
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, ""Hey, are you okay?""
And I ain't trying to mess with your self-expression
But I've learned the lesson that stressin'
And obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones so
So, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down
You're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (oh)
You need to just stop
Like, can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're coming at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad?
When you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Making that sign, must've taken all night
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay so
So, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down
You're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (oh)
You need to just stop
Like, can you just not step on his gown?
You need to calm down
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now, we all got crowns
You need to calm down
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down (you need to calm down)
You're being too loud (you're being too loud)
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (oh)
You need to just stop (can you stop?)
Like, can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm down"

Walau harus menunggu s'ribu tahun lamanya
Selama apa pun itu
Ku akan setia menunggu

Tergila-gila,Tulus,"Hari ini kau mesra
Besok lusa kau dingin
Kau buatku penasaran
Bisa hilang seminggu
Lalu terus disisiku
Kau buatku penasaran

Lihat wajahmu yang sendu
Itu yang paling kau andalkan
Kau menang-menangkan hatiku
Kau buatku tergila-gila
Kau pintar buat aku rindu
Kau buatku tergila-gila
Sayangku
Ini bukan yang pertama tapi ini paling menarik

Hati-Hati Di Jalan,Tulus,"Perjalanan membawamu
Bertemu denganku
Ku bertemu kamu
Sepertimu yang kucari
Konon aku juga seperti yang kau cari
Kukira kita asam dan garam
Dan kita bertemu di belanga
Kisah yang ternyata tak seindah itu
Kukira kita akan bersama
Begitu banyak yang sama
Latarmu dan latarku
Kukira takkan ada kendala
Kukira inikan mudah
Kau aku jadi kita
Kasih sayangmu membekas
Redam kini sudah pijar istimewa
Entah apa maksud dunia
Tentang ujung cerita
Kita tak bersama
Semoga rindu ini menghilang
Konon katanya waktu sembuhkan
Akan adakah lagi yang sepertimu
Kukira kita akan bersama
Begitu banyak yang sama
Latarmu dan latarku
Kukira takkan ada kendala
Kukira inikan mudah
Kau aku jadi kita
Kau melanjutkan perjalananmu
Ku melanjutkan perjalananku
Uh uh uh
Kukira kita akan bersama
Begitu banyak yang sama
Latarmu dan latarku
Kukira takkan ada kendala
Kukira inikan mudah
Kau aku jadi kita
Kukira kita akan bersama
Hati-hati di jalan"
Lagu Untuk Matahari,Tulus,"Patah kadang semangat
Dengan mulut pedas berdebat
Yang hanya lihat salahmu ho
Gerah kadang pendengar
Dapat cibiran sang benar
Sinisme bukan untukmu ho
Mereka tak sempurna
Sama juga halnya denganmu
Jangan risaukan celamu oh
Mungkin mereka bulan
Tapi ingat kau matahari
Cahaya mereka darimu (menari bernyanyi)
Lakukan yang kau suka (hidupmu)
Bukan hidupnya (bicara bersorak hey)
Lakukan yang kau suka (hidupmu)
Bukan hidupnya
Mereka tak sempurna
Sama juga halnya denganmu
Jangan risaukan celamu
Mungkin mereka bulan
Tapi ingat kau matahari
Cahaya mereka darimu (buka hatimu)
Buka hatimu dengar
Biar senang beralasan
Kuatkan langkah jiwamu
Waspada yang cemburu
Tak semua kutukan berlaku
Kuatkan langkah hatimu (menari bernyanyi)
Lakukan yang kau suka (hidupmu)
Bukan hidupnya (bicara bersorak hey)
Lakukan yang kau suka (hidupmu)
Bukan hidupnya
Buktikan sekarang
Angkat penamu tulis
Bila gemar menulis yeah (hu )
Buktikan sekarang
Perkeras suaramu
Bila gemar bernyanyi yeah yeah (menari bernyanyi)
Lakukan yang kau suka (hidupmu)
Bukan hidupnya (bicara bersorak hey)
Lakukan yang kau suka (hidupmu)

Tanggal Merah,Tulus,"Satu hari
Hanya kamu dan dirimu
Menikmati tanah yang kau injak
Memandangi langit yang kau junjung
Berjalan terus berjalan, kaki berjalan
Walau tanpa tujuan takkan tersesat
Ini waktumu dengan dirimu, ayo bebaslah
Kikis tepat perlahan semua beban
Nanti 'kan datang lagi itu senyuman
Ini waktumu dengan dirimu, berbahagialah

Satu Hari Di Bulan Juni,Tulus,"Ho-ho wu-o
Kita tak perlu terlalu banyak uang
Hu-wo-u
Kita bahagia meski tak kemana-mana
Kamu cantik (cantik)
Meski tanpa bedak (tanpa bedak)
Rasakan ini senang didadaku memilikimu

Gajah,Tulus,"Setidaknya punya tujuh puluh tahun
Tak bisa melompat kumahir berenang
Bahagia melihat kawanan betina
Berkumpul bersama sampai ajal
Besar dan berani berperang sendiri
Yang aku hindari hanya semut kecil
Otak ini cerdas kurakit perangkat
Wajahmu tak akan pernah kulupa
Waktu kecil dulu
Mereka menertawakan
Mereka panggilku gajah
Ku marah ku marah
Kini baru ku tahu
Puji didalam olokan
Mereka ingatku marah
Jabat tanganku panggil aku gajah
Kau temanku kau doakan aku
Punya otak cerdas aku harus tangguh
Bila jatuh gajah lain membantu
Tubuhmu disituasi rela jadi tamengku
Kecil kita tak tahu apa-apa
Wajar bila terlalu cepat marah
Kecil kita tak tahu apa-apa
Yang terburuk kelak bisa jadi yang terbaik
Yang terburuk kelak bisa jadi yang terbaik
Kau temanku kau doakan aku
Punya otak cerdas aku harus tangguh
Bila jatuh gajah lain membantu
Tubuhmu disituasi rela jadi tamengku
Kau temanku kau doakan aku
Punya otak cerdas aku harus tangguh
Bila jatuh gajah lain membantu
Tubuhmu disituasi rela jadi tamengku

Bunga Tidur,Tulus,"Bekas gincu disudut bibir kiri
Didepan cermin sabtu pagi
Aku tak tau ini punya siapa
Cukup jauh dari mabuk rasanya
Dan ku tak bermimpi entahlah
Ini pertanda apa
Sering malu karena sujud
Hanya bila tertekan
Duhai pria yang mengaku ngaku dewasa
Konon kebal membeku
Didirikanpun tak mampu
Ini dia si jago pemalu
Bila kau pikir aku sekuat itu
Dua empat tujuh aku bahagia ho
Kau salah kawan.
Ku dilindungi dendangan.
Ini musikku
Dia pagar jarak pandangmu
Mustahil tak bercelah
Didepan cermin sabtu pagi
Aku bicara dengan pantun laguku
Bunga tidur bisa membawamu terkubur
Jauh dari sekedar akar
Hantui pikiran
Kadang ku jatuh cinta
Kadang naik si pitam
Kadang gelap malam
Kadang semua tuli
Kau salah kawan.
Ku dilindungi dendangan
Ini musikku
Dia pagar jarak pandangmu
Kau salah kawan.
Ku dilindungi dendangan
Ini musikku
Dia pagar jarak pandangmu.
Selama ku lihat engkau senang
Yang lainnya ku simpan sendiri"
Bumerang,Tulus,"Dia biarkanku jatuh cinta
Lalu dia pergi seenaknya
Dihantui ragu
Tapi tak peduli
Gegabah jadi alasannya
Pandangan yang takkan kulupa
Lama sudah aku tak punya
Lalu dia pergi menunggu dipaksa
Dirayu untuk bicara
Sudah jauh kini
Aku berjalan tinggalkan dirimu
Tak kulihat lagi
Apa yang membutakan
Oh ragamu
Sementara
Kau sibuk dengan permainanmu
Dengan hati yang lain
Nama yang lain
Sibuk merakit bumerang
Tuk menyerangmu
Berbalik menyerangmu
Dia bilang telah salah langkah
Kekaguman keliru arah
Puisi dan lagu
Yang sering kutulis
Hanya itu yang dia mau
Tapi hati
Sudah jauh kini
Aku berjalan tinggalkan dirimu
Tak kulihat lagi
Apa yang membutakan ooh raga mu
Sementara
Kau sibuk dengan permainanmu
Dengan hati yang lain
Nama yang lain
Sibuk merakit bumerang
Tuk menyerangmu
Berbalik menyerangmu
Tak ada maaf untuk dia
Nanti aku 'kan membalasnya
Dia harus tahu
Cinta ini benar
Bukan hanya mau biasa
Dia harus tahu
Cinta ini benar
Bukan hanya mau biasa"
Sepatu,Tulus,"Kita sadar ingin bersama
Tapi tak bisa apa-apa
Kita sadar ingin bersama
Tapi tak bisa apa-apa
Terasa langkah bila kita berdua
Terasa sedih bila kita dirak berbeda
Di dekatmu kotak bagai nirwana
Tapi saling sentuhpun kita tak berdaya hu-uu
Kita adalah sepasang sepatu
Selalu bersama tak bisa bersatu
Kita mati bagai tak berjiwa
Bergerak karena kaki manusia
Aku sang sepatu kananmu
Kamu sang sepatu kiri
Kusenang bila diajak berlari kencang
Tapi aku takut kamu kelelahan
Ku tak masalah bila terkena hujan
Tapi aku takut kamu kedinginan
Kita sadar ingin bersama
Tapi tak bisa apa-apa
Terasa lengkap bila kita berdua
Terasa sedih bila kita di rak berbeda
Di dekatmu kotak bagai nirwana
Tapi saling sentuh pun kita tak berdaya wo-oo
Kusenang bila diajak berlari kencang
Tapi aku takut kamu kelelahan
Ku tak masalah bila terkena hujan

No-no-no ye yee-ye

Cinta memang banyak bentuknya
Mungkin tak semua
Bisa bersatu
Bisa bersatu

Baru,Tulus,"Tak perlu kau ajak aku bicara
Tak akan pernah kumendengarnya
Ini aku yang dulu bahkan tak dapat sebelah dengar dari telingamu
Tak perlu pesolek berwangi bunga
Tak akan mampu luluhkan hatiku
Ini aku yang dulu bahkan tak dapat sebelah mata dari pandanganmu
Nikmatilah kejutanku
Ini aku yang baru
Nikmatilah rasa rindu
Tak lagi di kuasamu
Tak perlu gelitik aku tertawa
Tak lagi kulihat ada yang lucu
Ini aku yang dulu namanya terus jadi sisipan tiap leluconmu
Wo-hoo woo
Nikmatilah kejutanku
Ini aku yang baru
Nikmatilah rasa rindu
Tak lagi di kuasamu
Nikmatilah kejutanku
Nikmatilah rasa rindu
Tak lagi di kuasamu

Patuh aku demi kamu
Dulu lalu tinggal dulu

Manusia Kuat,Tulus,"Kau bisa patahkan kakiku
Tapi tidak mimpi-mimpiku

Ruang Sendiri,Tulus,"Beri aku kesempatan untuk bisa merindukanmu
Jangan datang terus
Beri juga aku ruang bebas dan sendiri
Jangan ada terus
Aku butuh tahu seberapa kubutuh kamu
Percayalah rindu itu baik untuk kita
Pagi melihatmu menjelang siang kau tahu
Aku ada di mana sore nanti
Tak pernah sekali pun ada malam yang dingin
Hingga aku lupa rasanya sepi
Tak lagi sepi bisa kuhargai
Baik buruk perubahanku tak akan kau sadari
Kita berevolusi
Bila kita ingin tahu seberapa besar rasa yang kita punya
Kita butuh ruang
Pagi melihatmu menjelang siang kau tahu
Aku ada di mana sore nanti
Tak pernah sekali pun ada malam yang dingin
Hingga aku lupa rasanya sepi
Tak lagi sepi bisa kuhargai
Kita tetap butuh ruang sendiri - sendiri
Untuk tetap menghargai rasanya sepi"
Pamit,Tulus,"Tubuh saling bersandar
Ke arah mata angin berbeda

Saat ku menanti fajar
Sudah coba berbagai cara
Agar kita tetap bersama
Yang tersisa dari kisah ini
Hanya kau takut ku hilang

Jangan paksakan genggamanmu
Izinkan aku pergi dulu
Yang berubah hanya tak lagi ku milikmu
Kau masih bisa melihatku
Kau harus percaya, ku tetap teman baikmu, oh-wo-uh

Hujan,Utopia,"Rinai hujan basahi aku
Temani sepi yang mengendap
Kala aku mengingatmu
Dan semua saat manis itu
Segalanya seperti mimpi
Kujalani hidup sendiri
Andai waktu berganti
Aku tetap takkan berubah
Aku selalu bahagia
Saat hujan turun
Karena aku dapat mengenangmu
Untukku sendiri
O-o-ow
Selalu ada cerita
Tersimpan di hatiku
Tentang kau dan hujan
Tentang cinta kita
Yang mengalir seperti air
Aku selalu bahagia
Saat hujan turun
Karena aku dapat mengenangmu
Untukku sendiri

Aku bsa tersenyum sepanjang hari
Karena hujan pernah menahanmu di sini

Karena hujan pernah menahanmu di sini

Bisa melihat wajahmu

Sudah, simpan saja rasa
Ini tanpa kau tahu
Bagaimana
Ku bisa dapatkan hatimu

Kesempatan untukku

Meninggalkan ku sendiri bersama bayanganku
Seandainya kau tau aku kan selalu cinta
Jangan kau lupakan kenangan kita selama ini
Kelak kau kan menjalani hidupmu sendiri

Surat cinta untuk starla,Virgoun,"Teruntuk kamu hidup dan matiku
Aku tak tahu lagi harus dengan kata apa aku menuliskannya
Atau dengan kalimat apa aku mengungkapkannya
Karna untuk kepergian kalinya
Kau buat aku kembali percaya akan kata cinta
Dan benar bahwa cinta masih berkuasa diatas segalanya
Ketika hati yang mudah rapuh ini
Diuji oleh duniawi diuji oleh materi
Untuk kesekian kali lagi lagi dan lagi
Kutuliskan kenangan tentang
Caraku menemukan dirimu
Tentang apa yang membuatku mudah
Berikan hatiku padamu
Takkan habis sejuta lagu
Untuk menceritakan cantikmu
Kan teramat panjang puisi
Tuk menyuratkan cinta ini
Telah habis sudah cinta ini
Tak lagi tersisa untuk dunia
Karena telah kuhabiskan
Sisa cintaku hanya untukmu
Aku pernah berpikir tentang
Hidupku tanpa ada dirimu
Dapatkah lebih indah dari
Yang kujalani sampai kini
Aku selalu bermimpi tentang
Indah hari tua bersamamu
Tetap cantik rambut panjangmu
Meskipun nanti tak hitam lagi
Bila habis sudah waktu ini
Tak lagi berpijak pada dunia
Telah aku habiskan
Sisa hidupku hanya untukmu
Dan telah habis sudah cinta ini
Tak lagi tersisa untuk dunia
Karena telah kuhabiskan
Sisa cintaku hanya untukmu
Untukmu
Hidup dan matiku
Bila musim berganti
Sampai waktu terhenti
Walau dunia membenci
Ku kan tetap disini
Bila habis sudah waktu ini
Tak lagi berpijak pada dunia
Telah aku habiskan
Sisa hidupku hanya untukmu
Telah habis sudah cinta ini
Tak lagi tersisa untuk dunia
Karena telah kuhabiskan
Sisa cintaku hanya untukmu"
Bukti,Virgoun,"Memenangkan hatiku
Bukanlah satu hal yang mudah
Kau berhasil membuat
Ku tak bisa hidup tanpamu
Menjaga cinta itu
Bukanlah satu hal yang mudah
Namun sedetik pun tak pernah kau
Berpaling dariku
Beruntungnya aku
Dimiliki kamu
Kamu adalah bukti
Dari cantiknya paras dan hati
Kau jadi harmoni saat ku bernyanyi
Tentang terang dan gelapnya hidup ini
Kaulah bentuk terindah
Dari baiknya Tuhan padaku
Waktu tak mengusaikan cantikmu
Kau wanita terhebat bagiku
Tolong kamu camkan itu
Meruntuhkan egoku
Bukanlah satu hal yang mudah
Dengan kasih lembut kau pecahkan
Kerasnya hatiku
Beruntungnya aku
Dimiliki kamu (ku ingin engkau tahu)
Kamu adalah bukti

Kau jadi harmoni saat ku bernyanyi
Tentang terang dan gelapnya hidup ini
Kaulah bentuk terindah (kaulah bentuk terindah)

Selamat (Selamat Tinggal),Virgoun,"Di tempat ini
Di tempat pertama aku menemukanmu
Kembali kudatangi tempat ini
Tapi ku dengan yang lain
Samar kudengar
Suara yang s'lalu kukenal itu suaramu
Kau terlihat bahagia bersamanya
Dia kekasihmu yang baru
Aku pun terdiam
Saat gadis kecil berlari ke arahmu
Gadis kecil yang miliki mata indah
Persis seperti matamu
Aku pun tersenyum
Dan kugenggam tangan wanita di sampingku
(Dan kau genggam tangannya dan kau genggam tangannya)
Dan berkata lirih di dalam hati (lirih hati)
Tentang semua ini
Andai dulu kau tak pergi dari hidupku
Takkan mungkin kutemui cinta yang kini kumiliki
Cinta yang menerima kekurangan
Dan merubah caraku memandang dunia
Andai dulu kupaksakan t'rus bersamamu
Belum tentu kisah kita berdua berakhir bahagia
Kisah yang mendewasakan kita berdua
Meski lewat luka
Satu hal yang kini aku mengerti
Meski berat bibir ini mengucap
Akan s'lalu ada kata selamat
Dalam setiap kata selamat tinggal
Andai dulu kau tak pergi dari hidupku (dari hidupmu)
Takkan mungkin kutemui cinta yang kini kumiliki (kumiliki)
Cinta yang menerima kekurangan (dan merubah caraku)
Dan merubah caraku memandang dunia (memandang dunia)

Sandaran Hati,Virzha,"Tak pernah aku begini
Teringat tentang dirimu
Begitu dalamnya cintaku padamu
Kurasa kujatuh hati
Meskipun kau tak akan tahu
Setiap saat ku menunggu dirimu
Baru kusadari cintaku ini
Bertepuk sebelah tangan saja
Takkan ada lagi cinta yang lain
Engkaulah sandaran hati
Cobalah buka hatimu
Kurasa kau akan tahu
Setiap saat ku menunggu dirimu
Baru kusadari cintaku ini
Bertepuk sebelah tangan saja
Takkan ada lagi cinta yang lain
Engkaulah sandaran hati
Nanti akan tiba
Kau telah mengerti pengorbananku
"
Jatuh Cinta,Virzha,"Aku jatuh cinta
'Tuk kesekian kali
Baru kali ini kurasakan
Cinta sesungguhnya
Tak seperti dulu
Kali ini ada pengorbanan
Cinta bukan sekedar
Kata-kata indah
Cinta bukan sekedar
Buaian, belaian, peraduan
Samudera cinta
Dari palung hati
Tak terukur dalamnya
Hingga saat perpisahan tiba
Mengundang air mata
Atau hanya secuil penyesalan
Cinta adalah ruang dan waktu
Datang dan menghilang
Semua karunia Sang Pencipta
Mungkinkah kamu sedang menatap bulan?
Bulan sabit yang sedang kupandangi
Mungkinkah kamu menangis
Di atas bintang khayalku?
Maafkanlah cinta
Atas kabut jiwa
Yang menutupi pandangan kalbu
"
Cinta Itu Buta,Virzha,"Cinta itu adalah pengorbanan
Pengorbanan adalah cinta
Cinta itu tangis dan tawa
Cinta adalah hati
Hati adalah cinta
Cinta itu adalah kerinduan
Kerinduan adalah cinta
Cinta itu nikmat dan perih
Cinta adalah nafsu
Nafsu adalah cinta
Cinta itu memang buta
Kalau tidak buta bukan cinta
Cuma sekedar sayang
Cinta tak perlu logika
Cinta butuh perasaan cinta
Tak butuh kenyataan
Cinta itu adalah cemburu
Cemburu adalah cinta
Cinta itu ruang dan waktu
Cinta adalah hidup
Hidup adalah cinta
Cinta itu adalah emosi
Emosi adalah cinta
Cinta itu sentuhan belaian
Cinta adalah jatuh
Jatuh adalah cinta
Cinta itu memang buta
Kalau tidak buta bukan cinta
Cuma sekedar sayang
Cinta tak perlu logika
Cinta butuh perasaan cinta
Tak butuh kenyataan
Cinta itu memang buta
Kalau tidak buta bukan cinta
Cuma sekedar sayang
Cinta tak perlu logika
Cinta butuh perasaan cinta
Tak butuh kenyataan
Cinta itu adalah pengorbanan
Pengorbanan adalah cinta"
Sepert Yang Kau Minta,Virzha,"Maafkan aku tak bisa memahami maksud amarahmu
Membaca dan mengerti isi hatimu
Ampuni aku yang telah memasuki kehidupan kalian
Mencoba mencari celah dalam hatimu
Aku tahu ku takkan bisa
Menjadi sperti yang engkau minta
Namun selama nafas berhembus aku kan mencoba
Menjadi seperti yang kau minta
Ampuni aku yang telah memasuki kehidupan kalian
Mencoba mencari celah dalam hatimu"
Kita Yang Beda,Virzha,"Tak pernah ku bayangkan secepat ini
Aku takutkan benar terjadi adanya
Perbedaan mengalahkan rasa
Dan kita menyerah kalah pada keadaan
Kau putuskan pergi melepaskan kita
Tuhan kita cuma satu kita yang berbeda
Hingga tak mungkin menyatu cinta yang terluka
Ku terima semua ini sebagai rahasia
Biar ku simpan selamanya kau di hatiku
Pekat malam jangan membuat resah
Hadapilah ini sebagai pelajaran hidup
Kau putuskan pergi melepaskan kita"
Cinta Tanpa Tapi,"Waode

Indahnya bercinta serasa di nirwana
Anganku 'tuk bersama
Selalu dan selamanya
Nikmati alunan ombak kehidupan
Engkaulah pencuri
Harta jiwa di hati
Takkan kusesali
Diriku kau miliki
Wahai kau tuan
Kau widuri permata di dalam jiwa
Denganmu bahagia
Waktu berlalu cepat dan tak kurasa
Indahnya bercinta serasa di nirwana
Anganku 'tuk bersama
Selalu dan selamanya
Nikmati alunan ombak kehidupan
Kau beriku cinta
Bagus tutur kata
Kau hangatkan sukma
Denganmu bahagia
Waktu berlalu cepat dan tak kurasa
Denganmu bahagia
Waktu berlalu cepat dan tak kurasa
Indahnya bercinta
Serasa dibuai mahligai nirwana
Anganku 'tuk bersama
Selalu dan selamanya
Nikmati alunan ombak kehidupan
Ombak kehidupan"
Tanpa Cinta,Yovie & Nuno,"Aku mencintaimu tanpa syarat
Aku rela menunggu sangat lama
Katamu suatu saat aku pasti
Jadi cintamu, satu cintamu
Aku ingin kau menerima seluruh hatiku
Aku ingin kau mengerti, di jiwaku hanya kamu
Namun bila kau tak bisa menerima aku
Lebih baik ku hidup tanpa cinta
Haruskah ku bersabar tanpa batas
Aku masih ingat semua janjimu
Namun setalah kamu mengenal dia
Kau berubah, kau tak sama
Aku ingin kau menerima seluruh hatiku
Aku ingin kau mengerti, di jiwaku hanya kamu
Namun bila kau tak bisa menerima aku
Lebih baik ku hidup tanpa cinta
Bodohkah diriku yang teralu setia padamu
Disaat kau tak sungguh sungguh
Mencintai aku (mencintai aku)
Menginginkan aku (menginginkan aku)
Ohh
Namun bila kau tak bisa menerima aku
Lebih baik ku hidup tanpa cinta
Aku ingin kau menerima seluruh hatiku
Aku ingin kau mengerti, di jiwaku hanya kamu
Namun bila kau tak bisa menerima aku
Lebih baik ku hidup tanpa cinta
Lebih baik ku hidup tanpa cinta
Ouwoo"
Janji Suci,Yovie & Nuno,"Dengarkanlah, wanita pujaanku
Malam ini akan kusampaikan
Hasrat suci kepadamu, dewiku
Dengarkanlah kesungguhan ini
Aku ingin mempersuntingmu
'Tuk yang pertama dan terakhir
Jangan kau tolak dan buatku hancur
Ku tak akan mengulang 'tuk meminta
Satu keyakinan hatiku ini
Akulah yang terbaik untukmu
Dengarkanlah, wanita impianku
Malam ini akan kusampaikan
Janji suci, satu untuk selamanya

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh"
Manusia Biasa,Yovie & Nuno,"Masih kuingat selalu saat kau berjanji padaku
Takkan pernah ada cinta yang lainnya
Terasa begitu indah
Tapi, semua berbeda saat kau kenali dirinya
Sadarkah dirimu diriku terluka?
Saat kau sebut namanya
Aku memang manusia biasa
Yang tak sempurna dan kadang salah
Namun, di hatiku hanya satu
Cinta untukmu luar biasa
Andaikan saja kau tahu
Aku takkan mudah berubah
Aku 'kan bertahan selalu bertahan
Sampai waktu memanggilku
Aku memang manusia biasa
Yang tak sempurna dan kadang salah
Namun, di hatiku hanya satu
Cinta untukmu luar biasa (aa-ah)
Kemanakah dirimu yang dulu cinta aku?
Dimanakah dirimu yang selalu merindukanku?
Oh-wo
Aku memang manusia biasa
Yang tak sempurna dan kadang salah
Namun, di hatiku hanya satu
Cinta untukmu luar biasa, (oh)
Aku memang manusia biasa
Yang tak sempurna dan kadang salah (aa-ah, dan kadang salah)
Namun, di hatiku hanya satu
Cinta untukmu luar biasa
Aku memang manusia biasa
Yang tak sempurna dan kadang salah (aa-ah)
Namun di hatiku hanya satu
Cinta untukmu luar biasa
(Cinta padamu luar biasa)
Cinta untukmu luar biasa
Ohh-oh-oh-uh"
Dia Milkku,Yovie & Nuno,"Semula ku tak tahu
Engkau juga kan ingin memilikinya
Bukankah ku lebih dulu
Bila engkau temanku
Sebaiknya tak mengganggu
Dia untukku
Bukan untukmu
Dia milikku
Bukan milikmu
Pergilah kamu
Jangan kau ganggu
Biarkan aku
Mendekatinya
Kamu
Tak akan mungkin
Mendapatkannya
Karena dia
Berikan aku
Pertanda cinta
Janganlah kamu banyak bermimpi, oh
Dia Untuk aku
Bukankah belum pasti
Kamu juga kan jadi
Dengan dirinya
Dia yang menentukan
Apa yang kan terjadi
Tak usah mengaturku
Dia untukku
Bukan untukmu
Dia milikku
Bukan milikmu
Lihatlah nanti
Lihatlah saja
Biarkan aku
Mendekatinya
Kamu
Tak akan mungkin
Mendapatkannya
Karena dia
Berikan aku
Pertanda juga
Janganlah kamu banyak bermimpi ooh
Kusarankan engkau mundur saja, ooh
Dia untukku
Bukan untukmu
Dia milikku
Bukan milikmu
Pergilah kamu
Jangan kau ganggu
Biarkan aku
Mendekatinya"
Merindu Lagi,Yovie & Nuno,"Sejak saat pertama melihat senyumannya
Jantung berdebar-debar, inikah pertanda?
Namun ternyata salah, harapanku pun musnah
Sejak aku melihat kau selalu dengannya
Tuhan, tolong, aku ingin dirinya
Rindu padanya, memikirkannya
Namun mengapa saat jatuh cinta?
Sayang, sayang, dia ada yang punya
Mungkin 'ku harus pergi untuk melupakannya
Dalam hati berkata takkan sanggup pergi, wow-wow-wow
Tuhan, tolong, aku ingin dirinya
Rindu padanya, memikirkannya
Namun mengapa saat jatuh cinta?
Sayang, sayang, dia ada yang punya
Telah 'ku coba menghapus bayang-bayang indah
Tetapi selalu aku merindu lagi, oh
Oh, mengapa 'ku tak bisa
'Ku tak bisa, 'ku tak bisa
Tuhan, tolong, aku ingin dirinya
Rindu padanya, memikirkannya
Namun mengapa saat jatuh cinta?
Sayang, sayang, dia ada yang punya
Tuhan, tolong, tolong aku
Jatuh cinta pada kekasih orang
Ingin lupa 'ku tak bisa
Sayang, sayang, dia ada yang punya
Tuhan, tolong, aku ingin dirinya
Rindu padanya, memikirkannya
Namun mengapa saat jatuh cinta?
Sayang, sayang, dia ada yang punya
Sayang, sayang, dia ada yang punya
Sayang, sayang, dia ada yang punya, wow-wow"
Menjaga Hati,Yovie & Nuno,"Masih tertinggal bayanganmu
Yang telah membekas di relung hatiku
Hujan tanpa henti seolah pertanda
Cinta tak di sini lagi, kau t'lah berpaling
Biarkan aku menjaga perasaan ini, oh
Menjaga segenap cinta yang telah kau beri
Engkau pergi, aku takkan pergi
Kau menjauh, aku takkan jauh
Sebenarnya diriku masih mengharapkanmu, oh, oh-oh
Masih adakah cahaya rindumu
Yang dulu selalu cerminkan hatimu?
Aku takkan bisa menghapus dirimu
Meski kulihat kini kau di seberang sana
Biarkan aku menjaga perasaan ini, oh
Menjaga segenap cinta yang telah kau beri
Engkau pergi, aku takkan pergi
Kau menjauh, aku takkan jauh
Sebenarnya diriku masih mengharapkanmu
Andai akhirnya
Kau tak juga kembali
Aku tetap sendiri
Menjaga hati
Oh, engkau pergi, aku takkan pergi
Kau menjauh, aku takkan jauh
Sebenarnya diriku masih mengharapkanmu
Biarkan aku menjaga perasaan ini, oh
Menjaga segenap cinta yang telah kau beri
Engkau pergi, aku takkan pergi
Kau menjauh, aku takkan jauh
Sebenarnya diriku masih mengharapkanmu
Sejujurnya diriku masih mengharapkanmu
Ho-oh
Ho-oh-oh
Ho-oh
"
Mengejar Mimpi,Yovie & Nuno,"Dan semenjak ada dia
Kamu bukan kamu yang seperti dulu
Tiada lagi kisah indah
Dan kini kusendiri berteman bayangmu
Malam kini berganti
Sunyi sepi untukku
Meskipun engkau telah pergi
Mungkin takkan kembali
Aku di sini tetap di sini, sayangku
Aku masih rindu padamu
Aku masih sayang padamu
Meski kini cintamu bukan aku
Dan kini aku tahu
Jendela hatimu tertutup untukku
Ingin kulihat lagi
Wajah yang selalu kurindu
Meskipun engkau telah pergi
Mungkin takkan kembali
Aku di sini tetap di sini, sayangku
Aku masih rindu padamu
Aku masih sayang padamu
Meski kini cintamu bukan aku
Ingin rasa aku berlari
Walau hanya mengejar mimpi
Aku masih rindu padamu
Aku masih sayang padamu
(Meski kini cintamu bukan aku)
Meskipun engkau telah pergi (pergi)
Mungkin takkan kembali (kembali)
Aku di sini tetap di sini, sayangku
Aku masih rindu padamu
Aku masih sayang padamu
Meski kini cintamu bukan aku
Meski kini cintamu bukan aku"
Sempat Memiliki,Yovie & Nuno,"Mengapa kita bertemu
Bila akhirnya dipisahkan
Mengapa kita berjumpa
Tapi akhirnya dijauhkan
Kau bilang hatimu aku
Nyatanya bukan untuk aku
Bintang dilangit nan indah
Dimanakah cinta yang dulu
Masihkah aku disana
Di relung hati dan mimpimu
Andaikan engkau disini
Andaikan tetap denganku
Aku hancur kuterluka
Namun engkaulah nafasku
Kau cintaku meski aku
Bukan dibenakmu lagi
Dan kuberuntung sempat memilikimu
Bintang di langit nan indah (indah)
Dimanakah cinta yang dulu
Masihkah aku di sana (di sana)
Di relung hati dan mimpimu (oh wo wo)
Andaikan engkau di sini
Andaikan tetap denganku
Aku hancur kuterluka
Namun engkaulah nafasku
Kau cintaku meski aku
Bukan dibenakmu lagi
Dan kuberuntung sempat memilikimu
Engkau mengatakan merindukan diriku lagi
Ingin kusampaikan
Ku tak hanya sekedar itu
Wou- wou wo
Wou-wou wo
(Dara-da ra-da rada rara)
Aku hancur kuterluka
Namun engkaulah nafasku
Kau cintaku meski aku
Bukan dibenakmu lagi
Dan kuberuntung sempat memilikimu
Mu- wo - o o o
Aku hancur kuterluka
Namun engkaulah nafasku
Kau cintaku meski aku
Bukan dibenakmu lagi
Dan kuberuntung sempat memilikimu
Dan kuberuntung sempat memilikimu"
Sampai Akhir Waktu,Yovie & Nuno,"Ku akan datang lagi
Meski ibumu melarang
Kutunjukkan kesungguhan
Untuk miliki dirimu
Yang kuingin bukan sekedar
Hanya untuk pacaran
Yang kumau memberikan seluruh cinta
Sampai akhir waktu nanti
Walau rintangan yang selalu datang
Aku takkan pernah mundur
Walau tantangan tak pernah berhenti
Cinta takkan pernah mati
Yang kuingin bukan sekedar
Hanya untuk pacaran
Yang kumau memberikan seluruh cinta
Sampai akhir waktu nanti
Aku tak main-main
Dengan semua ini
Meski ibumu melarang
(Kutunjukkan kesungguhan)
Untuk miliki dirimu
Yang kuingin bukan sekedar
Hanya untuk pacaran
Yang kumau memberikan seluruh cinta
Sampai akhir waktu nanti
Sampai akhir waktu nanti
Cintaku sepanjang masa"
Sakit Hati,Yovie & Nuno,"Ku tahu engkau pasti tahu
Betapa hancurnya aku
Bunga yang dulu begitu indah
Perginya entah kemana
Aku sakit, aku sakit hati
Kau terbangkan 'ku ke awan
Lalu jatuhkan ke dasar jurang
Aku sakit dan 'ku tak mengerti
Kau berikan mimpi indah
Namun kenyataan tak seindah mimpi
Sadar kini cinta tak berbalas
Dulu 'ku tak pernah menduga
Kau memberi harapan palsu
Genggam tangan dan senyuman itu
Seolah mengikat hati
Aku sakit, aku sakit hati
Kau terbangkan 'ku ke awan
Lalu jatuhkan ke dasar jurang
Aku sakit dan 'ku tak mengerti
Kau berikan mimpi indah
Namun kenyataan tak seindah mimpi
Sadar kini cinta tak berbalas
Oh, sendiri lagi, sendiri aku, sendiri aku lagi
Dimanakah cintamu yang selama ini untukku?
Aku sakit, aku sakit hati
Yeah, oh, ye-ye-ye-ye-yeah
Aku sakit, aku sakit hati
Kau terbangkan 'ku ke awan
Lalu jatuhkan ke dasar jurang
Aku sakit dan 'ku tak mengerti
Kau berikan mimpi indah
Namun kenyataan tak seindah mimpi
Sadar kini cinta tak berbalas
'Ku tahu engkau pasti tahu
Betapa hancurnya aku"
Malam Mingguku,Yovie & Nuno,"Lihat langit biru
Aku merindukanmu
Lihatlah diriku
Yang tak bisa melupakanmu
Mungkinkah aku kini ada di hatimu
Oooh
Aku ingin malam mingguku
Engkau selalu ada dekatku
Menemani peluk bintang-bintang
Bila nanti engkau milikku
Bila saja cinta berbalas
Kan ku sayang selama hidupku
Ku harapkan kau mengerti
Apa yang kurasakan
Jangan kau ragu dengan kesungguhan ini
Aku ingin malam mingguku
Engkau selalu ada dekatku
Menemani peluk bintang-bintang
Bila nanti engkau milikku
Bila saja cinta berbalas
Kan ku sayang selama hidupku
Andai engkau baca hatiku
Isinya hanya dirimu
Sayangku
O-oh
Oh-ho-hohuo
Oh-oho-ho-hhuo
Aku ingin malam mingguku
Engkau selalu ada dekatku
Menemani peluk bintang-bintang
Bila nanti engkau milikku
Bila saja cinta berbalas
Kan ku sayang selama hidupku
Oh percaya padaku yakin padaku
Jadikan aku kekasihmu
Aku ingin malam mingguku
Engkau selalu ada dekatku
Menemani peluk bintang-bintang
Bila nanti engkau milikku
Bila saja cinta berbalas
Kan ku sayang selama hidupku
Kan ku sayang selama hidupku"
Demi Hati,Yovie & Nuno,"Hari demi hari dan juga malam
Dari malam aku bernapas lalu
Mengingat semua tentangmu
Saat berdua hatikupun tergetar
Saat kau senyum hatikupun berdebar
Ternyata bukan milikku
Berulang kali kau titip salam untuknya
Ku tak rela tuk menyampaikannya
Taukah kamu taukah dirimu
Betapa diriku menginginkan dirimu
Pedih hatiku saat kusadari
Mencintamu yang cinta pada dia
Berharap kau segera melupakannya
Berharap kau tak lagi suka padanya
Tuhan tolong ubah hatinya
Berulang kali kau titip salam untuknya
Ku tak rela tuk menyampaikannya
Taukah kamu taukah dirimu
Betapa diriku menginginkan dirimu
Pedih hatiku saat kusadari
Mencintamu yang cinta pada dia
Salahkah bila kumenunggu
Demi hati yang mencintaimu
Taukah kamu taukah dirimu
Betapa diriku menginginkan dirimu
Pedih hatiku saat kusadari
Mencintamu yang cinta pada dia
Pedih hatiku saat kusadari
Mencintamu yang cinta pada dia
Mencintamu yang cinta pada dia
"
Lebih Baik Aku,Yovie & Nuno,"Adakah benar ku terlambat
Merebut dirimu dan hatimu
Ku tak akan peduli
Sampai akad mengikat dia
Takkan pernah ku jera
Kan ku buktikan lebih baik aku
Ku abaikan semua kisahmu kisahnya
Ku yakini diri takkan lama
Ku tak akan peduli
Sampai akad mengikat dia
Takkan pernah ku jera
Kan ku buktikan lebih baik aku
Meski badai menghadang
Tak surut langkah tuk rebut dirimu
Oh oh oh
Ku tak akan peduli
Sampai akad mengikat dia
Takkan pernah ku jera
Kan ku buktikan lebih (ku buktikan lebih)
Kan ku tunjukkan pasti (ku tunjukkan pasti)
Kan ku buktikan lebih baik aku oh"
Seperti Bintang,Yovie & Nuno,"Andai saja engkau tahu
Resahku karenamu
Andai aku di benakmu
Alangkah indah dunia
Bila ada satu nama ku rindu
Slalu sebutkan dirimu
Seperti bintang indah matamu
Andaikan sinarnya untuk aku
Seperti ombak debar jantungku
Menanti jawabanmu
Pernah aku dengar darimu
Engkau kini sendiri
Namun adakah kau dengarkan aku
Yang benar inginkan kamu
Seperti bintang indah matamu
Andaikan sinarnya untuk aku
Seperti ombak debar jantungku
Menanti jawabanmu
Mungkin aku terlalu
Berharap yang tak tentu
Adakah di hatimu
Seperti bintang indah matamu
Andaikan sinarnya untuk aku
Seperti ombak debar jantungku
Menanti jawabanmu
Seperti bintang indah matamu
Andaikan sinarnya untuk aku
Seperti ombak debar jantungku
Menanti jawabanmu
Menanti jawabanmu
Menanti jawabanmu..."
Adu rayu,Yovie Tulus Glenn,"Maukah lagi kau mengulang ragu
Dan sendu yang lama
Dia yang dulu pernah bersamamu
Memahat kecewa
Atau kau inginkan yang baru
Sungguh menyayangimu
Aku ingin dirimu
Yang menjadi milikku
Bersamaku mulai hari ini
Hilang ruang untuk cinta yang lain
Separuh jalan pernah dilewati
Meski ada kecewa
Aku yang dulu tak begitu lagi
Takkan ku ulangi
Jangan duluan kau berpaling
Beri ku kesempatan
Aku ingin dirimu
Tetap jadi milikku
Bersama ku mulai hari baru
Hilang ruang untuk cinta yang lain
Lupakan dia pergi denganku
Lupakanlah ragu denganku
Ooooo... Aku...
Aku ingin dirimu (Aku ingin dirimu)
Tetap jadi milikku (Jangan ulangi ragu)
Bersamaku mulai hari baru
Hilang ruang untuk cinta yang lain
Aku ingin dirimu (Aku ingin dirimu)
Yang menjadi milikku (Setengah jalanmu denganku)
Bersamaku mulai hari ini
Hilang ruang untuk cinta yang lain
Layak untuk cantikmu, itu aku"
Berawal dari tatap,Yura Yunita,"Berawal dari tatap
Indah senyummu memikat
Memikat hatiku yang hampa lara
Senyum membawa tawa
Tawa membawa cerita
Cerita kasih indah tentang kita
Terkadang kuragu
Kadang tak percaya
Tapi kuyakin kau milikku
Kau membuatku bahagia
Di saat hati ini terluka
Kau membuatku tertawa
Di saat hati ini terbawa
Terbawa oleh cintamu untukku
Untuk kita"
Peri Cintaku,Ziva Magnolya,"Di dalam hati ini, hanya satu nama
Yang ada di tulus hati kuingini
Kesetiaan yang indah takkan tertandingi
Hanyalah dirimu, satu peri cintaku
Benteng begitu tinggi
Sulit untuk kugapai, ho-oh

Gimme Love,Joji,"Gimme-gimme love, gimme-gimme love
Gimme-gimme love, gimme-gimme love
When I'm gone, when I'm gone
Gimme-gimme love, gimme-gimme love
Gimme-gimme love, gimme-gimme love
When I'm gone, when I'm gone
Swing around front, let me inside
Playin' my song into my sides
It hurts, I can't lie
Remember those times I fought to get out?
I want to get out
Those pictures so clear, the fade in my mind
You leavin' me here with ashes and fire
These people don't heal, these people don't feel
These people aren't real, so make me this deal
Won't you?
Gimme-gimme love, gimme-gimme love
Gimme-gimme love, gimme-gimme love
When I'm gone, when I'm gone
Gimme-gimme love, gimme-gimme love
Gimme-gimme love, gimme-gimme love
When I'm gone, when I'm gone
Look into your heart and let me know
Do things turn black and gray as they go?
When I'm far too gone, can you show me love? (Ooh)
Give me love (ooh)
Caught in a river of records and dreams
Oh, will you keep up with me?
Everyone's looking for someone to hold
But I can't let you go"
MODUS,Joji,"Speed it up, slow it down
Need control, need it now
I need to live a thousand times
I cannot stop, I cannot cry
I will not fret, I will not die
I am machine, I stay alive
Sometimes I think, sometimes I think
Sometimes I think, sometimes I (woo)
I've got no aim, a million rounds
Is nothing real? A hunnid pounds
Of heavy steel, it feels so loud
Tied to my chest, it feels so loud
I'll take a peek to across the peaks
This grass is neat, I'm quite unique
But I'd like to be, but I'd like to be
And I hope this is the hardest part
We try, we try
And when they say they're satisfied
They're lying, they're lying
Do forgive me, I've seen the treasure is in the bloom
But right now I'm just not strong enough for you
Sorry, you can see it in my retina
Focus in and out, I'm doin' better
Artificial ghost with no perception
I wanna be a Chevy not a Sentra (yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah)
I don't feel the way they programmed me to feel today
Some pieces fallin' from the waist up, I'm so sorry for delays
Just need one moment to erase that burning pain before the rage
I feel good, I feel good, I feel good, I fixed it
And I hope this is the hardest part
We try, we try
And when they say they're satisfied
They're lying, they're lying
Do forgive me, I've seen the treasure is in the bloom
But right now I'm just not strong enough for you
And I hope this is the hardest part
We try, we try
And when they say they're satisfied
They're lying, they're lying
Do forgive me, I've seen the treasure is in the bloom
But right now I'm just not strong enough for you"
Glimpse of Us,Joji,"She'd take the world off my shoulders if it was ever hard to move
She'd turn the rain to a rainbow when I was living in the blue
Why then if she's so perfect, do I still wish that it was you?
Perfect don't mean that it's working, so what can I do? (Ooh)
When you're out of sight in my mind
'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes, and that's where I find a glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch, but I'm thinking of the way it was
Said, ""I'm fine"" and said, ""I moved on""
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hoping I'll find a glimpse of us
Tell me he savors your glory, does he laugh the way I did?
Is this a part of your story? One that I had never lived
Maybe one day, you'll feel lonely
And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse
Maybe you'll start slipping slowly and find me again
When you're out of sight in my mind
'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes, and that's where I find a glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch, but I'm thinking of the way it was
Said, ""I'm fine"" and said, ""I moved on""
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hoping I'll find a glimpse of us
'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes, and that's where I find a glimpse of us

Hoping I'll find a glimpse of us"
Die For You,Joji,"Swear I couldn't sleep a wink last night
No point in turning off the lights
Not the same without your head on my shoulders
Growing pains, but I don't wanna get older
Almost like we left it all on read
Couple feelings never laid to rest
Didn't know that the party was over
And it's true that I need you, get closer
Burning photos, had to learn to let go, whoa
I used to weep
Somebody in another skin (another skin)
I heard that you're happy without me
And I hope it's true (I hope, I hope it's true)
It kills me a little, that's okay
'Cause I'd die for you
You know I'd still die for you
I hope you're getting everything you needed (needed)
Find the puzzle piece and feel completed (completed)
Just wanted you to know every reason
Hope you really know that I mean that
Couldn't see the forest from the trees
The only time we speak is in my dreams
Burning photos, had to learn to let go
I used to weep
Somebody in another skin (another skin)
I heard that you're happy without me
And I hope it's true (I hope, I hope it's true)
It kills me a little, that's okay
'Cause I'd die for you
You know I'd still die for you"
Sanctuary,Joji,"Go ahead and park after dark
Fallen star, I'm your one call away
Motel halls, neon walls
When night falls, I am your escape
When you lay alone, I ache
Something I wanted to feel
If you've been waiting for fallin' in love
Babe, you don't have to wait on me
'Cause I've been aiming for heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need
Not anyone, you're the one
More than fun, you're the sanctuary
'Cause what you want is what I want
Sincerity
Souls that dream alone lie awake
I'll give you something so real
If you've been waiting for fallin' in love
Babe, you don't have to wait on me
'Cause I've been aiming for Heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need
Pull me, oh, so close
'Cause you never know
Just how long our lives will be
If you've been waiting for fallin' in love
Babe, you don't have to wait on me
'Cause I've been aiming for Heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need"
Run,Joji,"I fell for your magic, I tasted your skin
And though this is tragic, at least I found the end
I witness your madness, you shed light on my sins
And if we share in this sadness, then where have you been?
I know you're not in love, like you used to be
Guess I'm not the one, like you used to think
So you just run
I know that I'm stuck in this misery
Guess I'm not enough, like you used to think
So I'll just run
You bathe in your victory
You blew out all my fumes
And if I took on the planet
Will I pay my dues?
Your love was a mystery
Yeah, my love is a fool
And I travel the country
Just to get to you
I know you're not in love, like you used to be
Guess I'm not the one, like you used to think
So you just run
I know that I'm stuck in this misery
Guess I'm not enough, like you used to think
So I'll just run
And I travel the country
And I travel the country just to get to you
I know you're not in love
I know you're not in love
I know you're not in love"

Waiting on the ones who didn't fight
I told you not to waste my fucking time
I told you never sing that song, you lied
You gon' jump through hoops
Know how many lines you'll do
Won't matter when you lose
Everything I've done for you
She don't wanna tell lies
(She don't wanna tell lies)
She don't wanna tell lies
(She don't wanna tell lies)
She just wanna feel alive
(She just wanna feel alive)
She just wanted more time
(She just wanted more time)
I'm looking for a long ride
(Looking for a long ride)
She just want a test drive
(She just want a test drive)
Dying on the west side
(Dying on the west side)
I'll see you in the next life
(See you in the next life)"
SLOW DANCING IN THE DARK,Joji,"I don't want a friend
I want my life in two (life in two)
Waiting to get there
Waiting for you (waiting for you)
When I'm around slow dancing in the dark
Don't follow me, you'll end up in my arms
You done made up your mind
I don't need no more signs
Can you?
Can you?
Give me reasons we should be complete
You should be with him, I can't compete
You looked at me like I was someone else, oh, well
Can't you see?
I don't wanna slow dance (I don't wanna slow dance)
In the dark, dark
When you gotta run (gotta run, gotta run)
Just hear my voice in you (my voice in you)
Shutting me out you (shutting me out)
Doing so great (so great, so great)
You
Used to be the one to hold you when you fall
Yeah, yeah, yeah (when you fall, when you fall)
I don't fuck with your tone (I don't fuck with your tone)
I don't wanna go home (I don't wanna go home)
Can it be one night?
Can you?
Can you?
Give me reasons we should be complete
You should be with him, I can't compete
You looked at me like I was someone else, oh, well
Can't you see?
I don't wanna slow dance (I don't wanna slow dance)
In the dark, dark
In the dark, dark"
WANTED U,Joji,"Here I am
Torn into a thousand shapes and folds
Torn into a thousand ways, I know (I know)
Fornicate inside your broken arms
Before I throw a smile your way, no more
I can't tell
If all my answers correlate at all
I'm telling you a thousand things, I know
I've been missing a long time
To know I had to move
I've been waiting my whole life
To know I wanted you
Are you feeling me slowly?
You can take your fucking time
And I promise I won't lie
Make it out alive
I'm on trial
I'm not so good at hiding loathsome truths
You see it on my face when I turn blue
So punish me, I'm hanging on your noose
So pull me up so I can breathe with you
I know
I've been missing a long time
To know I had to move
I've been waiting my whole life
To know I wanted you
Are you feeling me slowly?
You can take your fucking time
And I promise I won't lie
Make it out alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah"
WHY AM I STILL IN LA (feat. Shlohmo & D33J),Joji,"Girl, you choke me sitting airtight (airtight)
Ziploc right now (right now)
Will you let me win a fair fight?
Can't think right now
I can't lie, on my mind
I feel right, I feel right
I can't lie, on my mind
I feel right
I don't wanna live forever now, L.A.
I don't wanna live like that no more, L.A.
Only when we sleep
Promise that you'll keep
When you will never weep
Until you fail to breathe
Sleep tight, you were right all my life
Falling for your red eyes (red eyes)
Both dying right now (right now, right now)
Got me back on my old life
You're not my gal
You're not mine
You're not mine
You're not cool
You're not fine
I last lied
They ask why?
Like they can't die (they can't die)
I don't wanna live forever now, L.A.
I don't wanna live like that no more, L.A.
Only when we sleep
Promise that you'll keep
When you will never weep
Until you fail to breathe
Sleep tight, you were right all my life
Girl, you choke me sitting airtight
Ziploc right now
Will you let me win a fair fight?
Can't think right now
I can't lie, on my mind
I feel right, I feel right
I can't lie, on my mind
I feel right"
